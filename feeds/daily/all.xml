&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I was asked: “How have you become a software architect?”. We talked about necessary skills, experience and the amount of time and dedication it took to build up knowledge. Further, I went through the steps which I took, which technologies I have actively worked with or tried out and what I have learned during my professional and non-professional career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into details, let’s have a look at two definitions first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A software architect is a software expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. The leading expert is referred to as the chief architect.
&lt;em&gt;(Source: Wikipedia: Software Architect)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a system, represented by its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and the principles that determine the design and evolution of the system.
&lt;em&gt;(Source: Handbook of Software Architecture)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-levels-of-architecture" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#levels-of-architecture"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Levels of Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture can be done on several “levels” of abstractness. The level influences the importance of necessary skills. As there are many possible categorizations possible my favorite segmentation includes these 3 levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Level&lt;/strong&gt;: The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication usually within one development team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Level&lt;/strong&gt;: The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication between multiple development teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Level&lt;/strong&gt;: The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication across the organization. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/justinamiller/EnterpriseArchitecture"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to learn more on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes architects are also seen as “glue” between different stakeholders. Three examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal&lt;/strong&gt;: Bridge communication between business and developers or different development teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical&lt;/strong&gt;: Bridge communication between developers and managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrate different technologies or applications with each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the necessary skills an architect needs, we first need to understand typical activities. The following (non-final) list contains from my perspective the most important activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and decide development technology and platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define development standards, e.g., coding standards, tools, review processes, test approach, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support identifying and understanding business requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design systems and take decisions based on requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document and communicate architectural definitions, design and decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check and review architecture and code, e.g., check if defined patterns and coding standards are implemented properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with other architects and stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coach and consult developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail out and refine higher level design into lower level design
Note: Architecture is a continuous activity, especially when it is applied in agile software development. Therefore, these activities are done over and over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the laid-out activities specific skills are required. From my experience, read books and discussions we can boil this down to these 10 skills every software architect should have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Design, Decide, Simplify, Code, Document, Communicate, Estimate, Balance, Consult, Market
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through one by one. For every skill I have laid out some actions or insights to follow up to improve in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-1-design" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-design"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(1) Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a good design? This is probably the most important and challenging question. I will make a distinction between theory and practice. To my experience, having a mix of both is most valuable. Let’s start with theory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the basic design patterns&lt;/strong&gt;: Patterns are one of the most important tool an architect needs to have to develop maintainable systems. With patterns you can reuse design to solve common problems with proven solutions. The book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” written by the “Gang of Four” (GoF) is a must read to everyone who is in software development. Although the pattern where published more than 20 years ago they are still the basis of modern software architecture. For example the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was described in this book which is applied in many areas or is the basis for newer pattern, e.g. MVVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dig deeper into patterns and anti-pattern&lt;/strong&gt;: If you already know all basic GoF patterns, then extend your knowledge with more software design patterns. Or dig deeper into your area of interest. One of my favorite for application integration is the book “Enterprise Integration Patterns” written by Gregor Hohpe. This book is applicable in various areas whenever two applications need to exchange data, whether it is an old school file exchange from some legacy systems or modern Microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know quality measures&lt;/strong&gt;: Defining architecture is not an end. It has reasons why guidelines and coding standards are defined, applied and controlled. You do this because of quality and non-functional requirements. You want to have a system which is maintainable, reliable, adaptable, secure, testable, scaleable, usable, etc. And one piece to achieve all these quality attributes is to apply good architecture work. You could start to learn more about quality measures on wikipedia.
Theory is important. Practice is equally or even more important if you do not want to become an Ivory Tower Architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try out and understand different technology stacks&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this is the most important activity if you want to become a better architect. Try out (new) technology stacks and learn their ups and downs. Different or new technology comes with different design aspects and patterns. You most likely do not learn anything from just flipping through abstract slides but by trying it out by yourself and feel the pain or the relieve. An architect should not only have broad but also in some areas deep knowledge. It is not important to master all technology stacks but to have a solid understanding of the most important in your area. Also try out technology which is not in your area, e.g., if you are deep into SAP R/3 you should also try JavaScript and vice versa. Still, both parties will be surprised about the latest advances in SAP S/4 Hana. For example, you can try it by yourself and take a course at openSAP for free. Be curious and try out new things. Also try out stuff which you did not liked some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze and understand applied patterns&lt;/strong&gt;: Have a look at any current framework, e.g., Angular. You can study a lot of patterns in practice, e.g., Observables. Try to understand how it is applied in the framework, why it was done. And if you are really dedicated, have a deeper look into the code and understand how it was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be curious and attend User Groups&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-2-decide" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-decide"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(2) Decide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An architect needs to be able to take decisions and guide projects or the entire organization into the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know what is important&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not waste time with unimportant decisions or activities. Learn what is important. To my knowledge there is not a book which has these information (if you know one, please let me know). My personal favorites are these 2 characteristics which I usually consider when evaluating if something is important or not:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conceptional Integrity: If you decide to do it in one way, stick to it, even if it is sometimes better to do it differently. Usually, this leads to a more straightforward overall concept, eases comprehensibility and eases maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uniformity: If you for example define and apply naming conventions it is not about upper- or lowercase, but to have it applied everywhere in the same way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize&lt;/strong&gt;: Some decisions are highly critical. If they are not taken early enough workarounds are build up which are often unlikely to be removed later and are a nightmare for maintenance, or worse, developers simply stop working until a decision is taken. In such situations it is sometimes even better to go with a “bad” decision instead of having no decision. But before it comes to this situation, consider prioritizing upcoming decisions. There are different ways to do so. I suggest having a look at the Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) model which is widely used within agile software development. Especially the measures time criticality and risk reduction are critical to estimate the priority of architecture decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your competence&lt;/strong&gt;: Do not decide things which are not in your competence. This is critical as it may ruin your position as architect significantly if not considered. To avoid this, clarify with your peers which responsibilities you have and what is part of your role. If there are more than one architect, then you should respect the level of architecture in which you are currently deployed. As an lower level architect you better come up with suggestions for higher level architecture instead of decisions. Further, I recommend checking critical decisions always with a peer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate multiple options&lt;/strong&gt;: Always lay out more than one option if it comes to decisions. In the majority of the cases I was involved in, there was more than one possible (good) option. Going with only one option is bad in two respects: (1) It seems that you did not do your job properly and (2) it impedes making proper decisions. By defining measures, options can be compared based on facts instead of gut feelings, e.g. license costs or maturity. This usually leads to better and more sustainable decisions. Further, it eases to sell the decision to different stakeholders. Besides, if you do not have evaluated options properly you may miss arguments when it comes to discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-3-simplify" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-simplify"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(3) Simplify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the problem-solving principle Occam’s Razor which states to prefer simplicity. I interpret the principle as following: If you have too many assumptions about the problem to solve your solution will probably be wrong or lead to an unnecessary complex solution. Assumptions should be reduced (simplified) to come to a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shake the solution&lt;/strong&gt;: To get solutions simplified, it often helps to “shake” the solution and look at them from different positions. Try to shape the solution by thinking top-down and again bottom-up. If you have a data flow or process, then first think left to right and again right to left. Ask questions such as: “What happens to your solution in a perfect world?” Or: “What would company / person X do?” (Where X is probably not your competitor, but one of the GAFA companies.) Both questions force you to reduce assumptions as suggested by Occam’s Razor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a step back&lt;/strong&gt;: After intense and long discussions, highly complex scribbles are often the results. You should never ever see these as the final results. Take a step back: Have a look at the big picture again (abstract level). Does it still make sense? Then go through it on the abstract level again and refactor. Sometimes it helps to stop a discussion and continue the next day. At least my brain needs some time to process and to come up with better, more elegant and simpler solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide and Conquer&lt;/strong&gt;: Simplify the problem by dividing it into smaller pieces. Then solve them independently. Afterwards validate if the small pieces match together. Take the step back to have a look at the overall picture for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring is not evil&lt;/strong&gt;: It is totally ok to start with a more complex solution if no better idea can be found. If the solution is making troubles you can later rethink the solution and apply your learning. Refactoring is not evil. But before you start refactoring, keep in mind to have (1) enough automated tests in place which can ensure the proper functionality of the system and (2) the buy-in from your stakeholders. To learn more about refactoring I suggest reading “Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code” by Martin Fowler.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as an Enterprise Architect, the most abstract level of architecture, you should still know what developers are doing on their daily basis. And if you do not understand how this is done, you may face two major problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers won’t accept your sayings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not understand challenges and needs of developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a side project&lt;/strong&gt;: The purpose of this is to try out new technologies and tools to find out how development is done today and in the future. Experience is the combination of observations, emotions and hypothesis (“Experience and Knowledge Management in Software Engineering” by Kurt Schneider). Reading a tutorial or some pros and cons is good. But this is just “book knowledge”. Only if you try out things by yourself you can experience emotions and can built up hypothesis about why something is good or bad. And the longer you work with a technology the better your hypothesis will get. This will help you to take better decisions in your day to day work. As I started programming I had no code completion and only some utility libraries to speed up development. Obviously, with this background I would make wrong decisions today. Today, we have tons of programming languages, frameworks, tools, processes and practices. Only if you have some experience and a rough overview in the major trends you are able to take part of the conversation and to steer development into the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the right things to try out&lt;/strong&gt;: You cannot try out everything. This is simply impossible. You need a more structured approach. One source I recently discovered is the Technology Radar from ThoughtWorks. They categorize technologies, tools, platforms, languages and frameworks into four categories: Adopt, Trial, Assess and Hold. Adopt means “strong feeling to be ready for enterprise usage”, Trial means “enterprise should try it in one project that can handle the risk”, Assess means “explore how it affects your enterprise” and Hold means “process with caution”. With this categorization it is easier to get an overview of new things and their readiness to better evaluate which trend to explore next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architectural documentation is sometimes more and sometimes less important. Important documents are for example architectural decisions or code guidelines. Initial documentation is often required before coding starts and need to be refined continuously. Other documentation can be automatically generated as code can also be documentation, e.g. UML class diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean Code&lt;/strong&gt;: Code is the best documentation if done right. A good architect should be capable to distinguish between good and bad code. A really great resource to learn more about good and bad code is the book “Clean Code” by Robert C. Martin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate documentation where possible&lt;/strong&gt;: Systems are changing quickly and it is hard to update the documentation. Whether it is about APIs or system landscapes in form of CMDBs: The underlying information often changes too fast to keep the corresponding documentation up to date by hand. Example: For APIs you could auto generate documentation based on the definition file if you are model driven, or directly from the source code. A lot of tools exist for that, I think Swagger and RAML are a good starting point to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As much as necessary, as little as possible&lt;/strong&gt;: Whatever you need to document, e.g., decision papers, try to focus on only one thing at a time and include only the necessary information for this one thing. Extensive documentation is hard to read and to understand. Additional information should be stored in the appendix. Especially for decision papers it is more important to tell a convincing story instead of just throwing tons of arguments. Further, this saves you and your co-workers, who have to read it, a lot of time. Have a look at some documentation you have done in the past (source code, models, decision papers, etc.) and ask yourself the following questions: “Are all necessary information included to understand it?”, “Which information are really required and which could be omitted?” and “Does the documentation has a red line?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more about architecture frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;: This point could be applied to all other “technical” points as well. I put it here, as frameworks like TOGAF or Zachmann are providing “tools” which feel heavy on the documentation site, although their added value is not limited to documentation. Getting certified in such a framework teaches you to tackle architecture more systematically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-6-communicate" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#6-communicate"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(6) Communicate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my observations this is one of the most underestimated skill. If you are brilliant in design but cannot communicate your ideas, your thoughts are likely to have less impact or even fail to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how to communicate your ideas&lt;/strong&gt;: When collaborating on a board or flip chart, it is essential to know how to use it properly in order to structure you and your peers’ thoughts. I found the book “UZMO — Thinking With Your Pen” to be a good resource to enhance my skills in this area. As an architect you usually do not only participating in a meeting, usually you need to drive the meeting and to moderate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give talks to large groups&lt;/strong&gt;: Presenting your ideas to a small or large group should be doable for you. If you feel uncomfortable with this, start presenting to your best friend. Enlarge the group slowly. This is something which you can only learn by doing and by leaving your personal comfort zone. Be patient with yourself, this process may take some time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the right level of communication&lt;/strong&gt;: Different stakeholders have different interests and views. They need to be addressed individually on their level. Before you communicate, step back and check if the information you want to share have the right level, regarding abstractness, content, goals, motivations, etc. Example: A developer is usually interested in the very little detail of the solution, whereas a manager prefers to know which option saves most money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate often&lt;/strong&gt;: A brilliant architecture is worthless if nobody knows about it. Distribute the target architecture and the thoughts behind it, regularly and on every (organizational) level. Schedule meetings with developers, architects and managers to show them the desired or defined way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be transparent&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular communication mitigates missing transparency only partially. You need to make the reason behind decisions transparent. Especially, if people are not involved in the decision-making process it is hard to understand and to follow the decision and rationale behind it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be always prepared to give a presentation&lt;/strong&gt;: There is always someone with questions and you want to give the right answers immediately. Try to always have the most important slides in a consolidated set which you can show and explain. It saves you a lot of time and it gives security to yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know basic project management principles&lt;/strong&gt;: As architect or lead developer you are often asked for estimates to realize your ideas: How long, how much, how many people, which skills, etc.? Of course, if you plan to introduce new tools or frameworks you need to have an answer for these kind of “management” questions. Initially, you should be able to give a rough estimate, like days, months or years. And do not forget that it is not only about implementing, there are more activities to consider, like requirements engineering, testing and fixing bugs. Therefore, you should know the activities the used software development process. One thing you can apply to get better estimates, is to use past data and derive your prediction from that. If you do not have past data, you can also try approaches such as COCOMO by Barry W. Boehm. If you are deployed in an agile project, learn how to estimate and to plan properly: The book “Agile Estimating and Planning” by Mike Cohn provides a solid overview in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate “unknown” architecture&lt;/strong&gt;: As architect you should also be able to evaluate the suitability of architectures for the current or future context(s). This is not an easy task but you can prepare for it by having a set of questions at hand which are common for every architecture. And it’s not only about architecture but also about how the system is managed, as this also gives you insides about the quality. I suggest to always have some questions prepared and ready to use. Some ideas for general questions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design practices: Which patterns does the architecture follow? Are they consequently and correctly used? Does the design follow a red line or is there an uncontrolled growth? Is there a clear structure and separation of concerns?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development practices: Code guidelines in place and followed? How is the code versioned? Deployment practices?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality assurance: Test automation coverage? Static code analysis in place and good results? Peer reviews in place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security: Which security concepts are in place? Built-in security? Penetration tests or automated security analysis tools in place and regularly used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality comes at a price&lt;/strong&gt;: Earlier I talked about quality and non-functional requirements. If you overdo architecture it will increase costs and probably lower speed of development. You need to balance architectural and functional requirements. Over engineering should be avoided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solve contradicting goals&lt;/strong&gt;: A classic example of contradicting goals are short- and long-term goals. Projects often tend to build the simplest solution whereas an architect has the long-term vision in mind. Often, the simple solution does not fit into the long-term solution and is at risk to be thrown away later (sunk costs). To avoid implementation into the wrong direction, two things need to be considered:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers and business need to understand the long term vision and their benefits in order to adapt their solution and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managers who are responsible for budget need to be involved to understand the financial impact. It is not necessary to have 100% of the long term vision in place directly, but the developed piece should fit into it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict management&lt;/strong&gt;: Architects are often the glue between multiple groups with different backgrounds. This may lead to conflicts on different levels of communication. To find a balanced solution which also reflect long-term, strategic goals, it is often the role of architects to help overcome the conflict. My starting point regarding communication theory was the “Four-Ears Model” of Schulze von Thun. Based on this model a lot can be shown and deducted. But this theory needs some practice, which should be experienced during communication seminars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-9-consult-and-coach" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#9-consult-and-coach"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(9) Consult and Coach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being pro-active is probably the best you can do when it comes to consulting and coaching. If you are asked, it is often too late. And cleaning up on the architecture site is something which you want to avoid. You need to somehow foresee the next weeks, months or even years and prepare yourself and the organization for the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a vision&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are deployed in a project, whether it is a traditional waterfall like approach or agile, you always need to have a vision of your mid- and long-term goals you want to achieve. This is not a detailed concept, but more a road-map towards everyone can work. As you cannot achieve everything at once (it is a journey) I prefer to use maturity models. They give a clear structure which can be easily consumed and give the current status of progress at every time. For different aspects I use different models, e.g. development practices or continuous delivery. Every level in the maturity model has clear requirements which follow the SMART criteria in order to ease measuring if you have achieved it or not. One nice example I found is for continues delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a community of practice (CoP)&lt;/strong&gt;: Exchanging experience and knowledge among a common interest group helps distributing ideas and standardizing approaches. For example you could gather all JavaScript developer and architects in one room, every three months or so, and discuss past and current challenges and how they were tackled or new methodologies and approaches. Architects can share, discuss and align their visions, developers can share experience and learn from their peers. Such a round can be highly beneficial for the enterprise but also for the individual itself, as it helps building a stronger network and distributes ideas. Also check out the article Communities of Practice from the SAFe Framework which explains the CoP concept in an agile setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct open door sessions&lt;/strong&gt;: One source of misconceptions or ambiguity is lack of communication. Block a fixed time slot, e.g. 30 min every week, for exchanging hot topics with your peers. This session has no agenda everything can be discussed. Try to solve minor things on the spot. Schedule follow-ups on the more complex topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-10-market" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#10-market"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(10) Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your ideas are great and you have communicated them well but still nobody wants to follow? Then you probably lack marketing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivate and convince&lt;/strong&gt;: How do companies convince you of buying a product? They demonstrate its value and benefits. But not just with 5 bullet points. They wrap it nicely and make it as easy as possible to digest.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototypes: Show a prototype of your idea. There are plenty of tools for creating prototypes. In the context of enterprises who love SAP check out build.me in which you can create nice looking and clickable UI5 apps fast and easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show a video: Instead of “boring slides” you can also show a video which demonstrates your idea or at least the direction.
But please, don’t overdo marketing: In the long term, content is king. If your words do not come true, this will damage your reputation in the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight for your ideas and be persistent&lt;/strong&gt;: People sometime do not like your ideas or they are just too lazy to follow them. If you are really convinced by your ideas, you should continuously go after them and “fight”. This is sometimes necessary. Architecture decisions with long term goals are often not the easiest one’s: Developers do not like them, as they are more complex to develop. Managers do not like them, as they are more expensive in the short term. This is your job to be persistent and to negotiate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find allies&lt;/strong&gt;: Establishing or enforcing your ideas on your own can be hard or even impossible. Try to find allies who can support and help convincing others. Use your network. If you do not have one yet, start building it now. You could start by talking to your (open-minded) peers about your ideas. If they like it, or at least parts of it, it is likely that they support your idea if asked by others (“The idea by X was interesting.”). If they don’t like it, ask for the why: Maybe you have missed something? Or your story is not convincing enough? Next step is to find allies with decision power. Ask for an open-minded discussion. If you fear the discussion, remember that sometimes you need to leave your comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat It, Believe It&lt;/strong&gt;: “[…] studies show that repeated exposure to an opinion makes people believe the opinion is more prevalent, even if the source of that opinion is only a single person.” (Source: The Financial Brand) If you publish few messages often enough, it can help to convince people more easily. But be aware: From my perspective such a strategy should be used wisely as it could backfire as a lousy marketing trick.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clean Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/3rs-of-software-architecture"&gt;readable, reusable, and refactorable&lt;/a&gt; software in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
&lt;em&gt;Clean Code&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are
still learning a lot. When software architecture is as old as architecture
itself, maybe then we will have harder rules to follow. For now, let these
guidelines serve as a touchstone by which to assess the quality of the
JavaScript code that you and your team produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing: knowing these won't immediately make you a better software
developer, and working with them for many years doesn't mean you won't make
mistakes. Every piece of code starts as a first draft, like wet clay getting
shaped into its final form. Finally, we chisel away the imperfections when
we review it with our peers. Don't beat yourself up for first drafts that need
improvement. Beat up the code instead!&lt;/p&gt;

do write is readable and searchable. By &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js"&gt;buddy.js&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md"&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it
makes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a
combinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with
each separate argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have
more than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases
where it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an
argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class
boilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a
lot of arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6
destructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what
properties are being used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument
object passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects. Note:
objects and arrays that are destructured from the argument object are NOT
cloned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linters can warn you about unused properties, which would be impossible
without destructuring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that
you keep this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with
tomatoes in them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly
different things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you
to have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing
duplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of
different things with just one function/module/class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the
SOLID principles laid out in the &lt;em&gt;Classes&lt;/em&gt; section. Bad abstractions can be
worse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make
a good abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself
updating multiple places anytime you want to change one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, primitives are passed by value and objects/arrays are passed by
reference. In the case of objects and arrays, if your function makes a change
in a shopping cart array, for example, by adding an item to purchase,
then any other function that uses that &lt;code&gt;cart&lt;/code&gt; array will be affected by this
addition. That may be great, however it can be bad too. Let's imagine a bad
situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user clicks the "Purchase", button which calls a &lt;code&gt;purchase&lt;/code&gt; function that
spawns a network request and sends the &lt;code&gt;cart&lt;/code&gt; array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the &lt;code&gt;purchase&lt;/code&gt; function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because it has a reference to a shopping
cart array that the &lt;code&gt;addItemToCart&lt;/code&gt; function modified by adding an unwanted
item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great solution would be for the &lt;code&gt;addItemToCart&lt;/code&gt; to always clone the &lt;code&gt;cart&lt;/code&gt;,
edit it, and return the clone. This ensures that no other functions that are
holding onto a reference of the shopping cart will be affected by any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two caveats to mention to this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
this isn't a big issue in practice because there are
&lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/" rel="nofollow"&gt;great libraries&lt;/a&gt; that allow
this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an
exception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to
extend JavaScript's native Array method to have a &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; method that could
show the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function
to the &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype&lt;/code&gt;, but it could clash with another library that tried
to do the same thing. What if that other library was just using &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; to find
the difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it
would be much better to just use ES2015/ES6 classes and simply extend the &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt; global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working with basic primitive values like strings and integers,
and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check,
you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal
JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript
syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that
doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get
doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript clean, write
good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with
TypeScript (which, like I said, is a great alternative!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply
looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes adding validation simple when doing a &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encapsulates the internal representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern is very useful in JavaScript and you see it in many libraries such
as jQuery and Lodash. It allows your code to be expressive, and less verbose.
For that reason, I say, use method chaining and take a look at how clean your code
will be. In your class functions, simply return &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; at the end of every function,
and you can chain further class methods onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated famously in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Patterns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Gang of Four,
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a"
relationship (Human-&amp;gt;Animal vs. User-&amp;gt;UserDetails).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify
a piece of it, it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other
dependent modules in your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as "If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)." That's an even scarier definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the "is-a" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so this principle doesn't apply as strictly
as others. However, it's important and relevant even with JavaScript's lack of
type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use." Interfaces are implicit contracts in JavaScript because of
duck typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle in JavaScript is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to setup
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a
"fat interface".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This principle states two essential things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,
you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions
that are depended upon are implicit contracts. That is to say, the methods
and properties that an object/class exposes to another object/class. In the
example below, the implicit contract is that any Request module for an
&lt;code&gt;InventoryTracker&lt;/code&gt; will have a &lt;code&gt;requestItems&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  }

  &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;requestItem&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;) {
    &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is more important than shipping. If you have no tests or an
inadequate amount, then every time you ship code you won't be sure that you
didn't break anything. Deciding on what constitutes an adequate amount is up
to your team, but having 100% coverage (all statements and branches) is how
you achieve very high confidence and developer peace of mind. This means that
in addition to having a great testing framework, you also need to use a
&lt;a href="https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/" rel="nofollow"&gt;good coverage tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no excuse to not write tests. There are &lt;a href="https://jstherightway.org/#testing-tools" rel="nofollow"&gt;plenty of good JS test frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, so find one that your team prefers.
When you find one that works for your team, then aim to always write tests
for every new feature/module you introduce. If your preferred method is
Test Driven Development (TDD), that is great, but the main point is to just
make sure you are reaching your coverage goals before launching any feature,
or refactoring an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promises are a very clean alternative to callbacks, but ES2017/ES8 brings async and await
which offer an even cleaner solution. All you need is a function that is prefixed
in an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and then you can write your logic imperatively without
a &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; chain of functions. Use this if you can take advantage of ES2017/ES8 features
today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrown errors are a good thing! They mean the runtime has successfully
identified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting
you know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the
process (in Node), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix
or react to said error. Logging the error to the console (&lt;code&gt;console.log&lt;/code&gt;)
isn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed
to the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; it means you
think an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,
or create a code path, for when it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast
rule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.
There are &lt;a href="https://standardjs.com/rules.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;tons of tools&lt;/a&gt; to automate this.
Use one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting
(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here
for some guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use &lt;code&gt;actix&lt;/code&gt;, add this to your &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-toml"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;dependencies&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;actix&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;0.9&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-initialize-actix" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initialize-actix"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Initialize Actix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use actix you first need to create a &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-rust"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;() {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; system &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; actix&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;System&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;);

    system.&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;();
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actix uses the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio"&gt;tokio&lt;/a&gt; event loop.
&lt;code&gt;System::new()&lt;/code&gt; creates a new event loop and starts the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; actor.
&lt;code&gt;system.run()&lt;/code&gt; starts the tokio event loop, and will finish once the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; actor
receives the &lt;code&gt;SystemExit&lt;/code&gt; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's create a simple Actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to define an actor you need to define a struct and have it implement
the &lt;a href="https://actix.github.io/actix/actix/trait.Actor.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Actor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-rust"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; actix&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;{Actor, Addr, Arbiter, Context, System};

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;MyActor&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Actor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;MyActor&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt; = Context&amp;lt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;;

    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;started&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;, ctx: &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;::Context) {
       &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;"I am alive!"&lt;/span&gt;);
       System&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt;().&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;(); &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// &amp;lt;- stop system&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;() {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; system &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; System&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;"test"&lt;/span&gt;);

    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; addr &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; MyActor.&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;();

    system.&lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;();
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spawning a new actor is achieved via the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; methods of
the &lt;a href="https://actix.github.io/actix/actix/trait.Actor.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Actor&lt;/a&gt;
trait. It provides several different ways of creating actors, for details check docs.
You can implement &lt;code&gt;started&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stopping&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stopped&lt;/code&gt; methods of the Actor trait.
&lt;code&gt;started&lt;/code&gt; gets called when actor starts and &lt;code&gt;stopping&lt;/code&gt; when actor finishes.
Check &lt;a href="https://actix.github.io/actix/actix/trait.Actor.html#actor-lifecycle" rel="nofollow"&gt;API documentation&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the actor lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Actor communicates with another Actor by sending messages. In actix all messages
are typed. Let's define a simple &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; message with two &lt;code&gt;usize&lt;/code&gt; parameters,
and an actor which will accept this message and return the sum of those two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-rust"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; futures&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;{future, Future};
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; actix&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// this is our Message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// we have to define the response type for `Sum` message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;;
}

&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// Actor definition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Summator&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Actor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Summator&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt; = Context&amp;lt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;;
}

&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// now we need to define `MessageHandler` for the `Sum` message.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Handler&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Sum&amp;gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Summator&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;;   &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;// &amp;lt;- Message response type&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;handle&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;, msg: Sum, ctx: &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Context&amp;lt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Self&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt; {

&lt;p&gt;All communications with actors go through an &lt;code&gt;Addr&lt;/code&gt; object. You can &lt;code&gt;do_send&lt;/code&gt; a message
without waiting for a response, or &lt;code&gt;send&lt;/code&gt; an actor with specific message. The &lt;code&gt;Message&lt;/code&gt;
trait defines the result type for a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that methods of &lt;code&gt;Actor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt; traits accept &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mut self&lt;/code&gt;, so you are
welcome to store anything in an actor and mutate it whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Address objects require an actor type, but if we just want to send a specific message to
an actor that can handle the message, we can use the &lt;code&gt;Recipient&lt;/code&gt; interface. Let's create
a new actor that uses &lt;code&gt;Recipient&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-rust"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; std&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;time&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Duration;

&lt;p&gt;This is a proof of concept project I threw together over the last few days, it's not perfect, but it looks nice. This uses web rtc to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, I made this because &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it" rel="nofollow"&gt;rabb.it&lt;/a&gt; went under and my internet can't handle streaming and discord keeps crashing. I just want to watch anime with my friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so I started digging throughout the net and found a few &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; clones, but non of them had the virtual browser, then I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus"&gt;Turtus&lt;/a&gt; and I was able to figure out the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a fully featured clone of rabbit. The client has no concept of other peers. It has bugs, but for the most part it works. I'm not sure what the future holds for this. If I continue to use it and like it, I'll probably keep pushing updates to it. I'd be happy to accept PRs for any improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another day, another "unsafe shitstorm”, I guess I get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting how easy to move comment out of context and how hard to comment with very clear intention (especially if you are not native speaker) What was the patch? It was very strait forward, simple, uncreative change, intention was just to remove unsafe not to fix existing code. I believe software development is one of the most creative work we do, and creativity is part of why we love software development, why it is fun. Especially if you combine it with real world projects constraints. “creative constrains” could be source of very interesting solutions. Being on the edge of your abilities is super fun. So uncreative change felt boring (oh! And author gave up copyright claims for that patch (a bit irony and sarcasm)). I’ve never used unsafe unintentionally, I use it because I believe usage is safe. There was no any malicious intentions. I believed it held mutable aliasing invariant and I was very happy that someone found real problem. I wanted to solve the problem, just with a bit of creativity. And use RefCell solution only if it would be not possible to solve it with any other way. Btw, I like the solution I found, it is in master and solves the problem at least one from the issue. If you want to push boundaries you have to touch this boundaries and sometimes you push too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a maintainer of large open source project is not a fun task. You alway face with rude and hate, everyone knows better how to build software, nobody wants to do home work and read docs and think a bit and very few provide any help. Seems everyone believes there is large team behind actix with unlimited time and budget. (Btw thanks to everyone who provided prs and other help!) For example, async/await took three weeks 12 hours/day work stint, quite exhausting, and what happened after release, I started to receive complaints that docs are not updated and i have to go fix my shit. Encouraging. You could notice after each unsafe shitstorm, i started to spend less and less time with the community. You felt betrayed after you put so much effort and then to hear all this shit comments, even if you understand that that is usual internet behavior.  Anyway, removing issue was a stupid idea. But I was pissed off with last two personal comments, especially while sitting and thinking how to solve the problem. I am sorry for doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been three years since I started actix project (time flies). I learnt a lot, i meet new people, I found language that I really like and want to use it fulltime, I found fun job. But damage to the project's reputation is done and I don’t think it is possible to recover. Actix always will be “shit full of UB” and “benchmark cheater”. (Btw, with tfb benchmark I just wanted to push rust to the limits, I wanted it to be on the top, I didn’t want to push other rust frameworks down.) Everything started with actix, then actix-web and then actix-net. It took a lot of time to design api and architecture. Each of this projects was rewritten from scratch at least 4-5 time. I hope I expanded some boundaries and found few new patterns, I hope other developers will check source code and find inspiration to move even further. Nowadays supporting actix project is not fun, and be part of rust community is not fun as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am done with open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I moved actix-net and actix-web project to my personal github account. I will make decision during next couple days what to do. I don’t want to see the project becomes ghost of what it was. Maintainers must understand how everything work, but don’t anyone who does and those who could are busy with other projects. At the moment I am planing to make repos private and then delete them (will remove benchmarks as well), unless others suggest better ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything has to come to the end. It was fun trip but now is time to move on. Life should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax"&gt;Trax&lt;/a&gt; helps you understand and explore advanced deep learning.
We &lt;a href="#structure"&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; on making Trax code clear while pushing advanced models like
&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/models/reformer"&gt;Reformer&lt;/a&gt; to their limits.
Trax is actively used and maintained in the &lt;a href="https://research.google.com/teams/brain/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Google Brain team&lt;/a&gt;.
Give it a try, &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/trax-ml/community" rel="nofollow"&gt;talk to us&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/issues"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-use-trax" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#use-trax"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Use Trax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Trax either as a library from your own python scripts and notebooks
or as a binary from the shell, which can be more convenient for training large models.
Trax includes a number of deep learning models (ResNet, Transformer, RNNs, ...)
and has bindings to a large number of deep learning datasets, including
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor"&gt;Tensor2Tensor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview" rel="nofollow"&gt;TensorFlow datasets&lt;/a&gt;.
It runs without any changes on CPUs, GPUs and TPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how to use Trax as a library, take a look at this &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/trax/blob/master/trax/intro.ipynb" rel="nofollow"&gt;quick start colab&lt;/a&gt;
which explains how to create data in python, connect it to a Transformer model in Trax, train it and run inference.
You can select a CPU or GPU runtime, or even get a free 8-core TPU as
runtime. With TPUs in colab you need to set extra flags as demonstrated in these
&lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/trax/blob/master/trax/models/reformer/text_generation.ipynb" rel="nofollow"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/trax/blob/master/trax/models/reformer/image_generation.ipynb" rel="nofollow"&gt;inference&lt;/a&gt; colabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use Trax as a binary and not forget all the parameters (model type, learning
rate, other hyper-paramters and training settings), we recommend &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/gin-config"&gt;gin-config&lt;/a&gt;.
Take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/configs/mlp_mnist.gin"&gt;an example gin config&lt;/a&gt;
for training a simple MLP on MNIST and run it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m trax.trainer --config_file=$PWD/trax/configs/mlp_mnist.gin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a more advanced example, you can train a &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/models/reformer"&gt;Reformer&lt;/a&gt;
on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08819" rel="nofollow"&gt;Imagenet64&lt;/a&gt; to generate images &lt;a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/trax/blob/master/trax/models/reformer/image_generation.ipynb" rel="nofollow"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;
with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m trax.trainer --config_file=$PWD/trax/configs/reformer_imagenet64.gin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-structure" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#structure"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trax code is structured in a way that allows you to understand deep learning
from scratch. We start with basic maths and go through layers, models,
supervised and reinforcement learning. We get to advanced deep learning
results, including recent papers such as &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reformer - The Efficient Transformer&lt;/a&gt;,
selected for oral presentation at &lt;a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/" rel="nofollow"&gt;ICLR 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main steps needed to understand deep learning correspond to sub-directories
in Trax code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/math"&gt;math/&lt;/a&gt; — basic math operations and ways to accelerate them on GPUs and TPUs (through &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/jax"&gt;JAX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/layers"&gt;layers/&lt;/a&gt; are the basic building blocks of neural networks and here you'll find how they are build and all the needed ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/models"&gt;models/&lt;/a&gt; contains all basic models (MLP, ResNet, Transformer, ...) and a number of new research models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/optimizers"&gt;optimizers/&lt;/a&gt; is a directory with optimizers needed for deep learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/supervised"&gt;supervised/&lt;/a&gt; contains the utilities needed to run supervised learning and the Trainer class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/rl"&gt;rl/&lt;/a&gt; contains our work on reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the most recent update on Trax development, &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/trax-ml/community" rel="nofollow"&gt;chat with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most common supervised learning models in Trax are running and should have clear
code — if this is not the case, please &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/issues"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt;
or, even better, send along a pull request (see &lt;a href="CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;our contribution doc&lt;/a&gt;).
In Trax we value documentation, examples and colabs so if you find any
problems with those, please report it and contribute a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still improving a few smaller parts of &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/layers"&gt;layers&lt;/a&gt;,
planning to update the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/supervised"&gt;supervised&lt;/a&gt; API and
heavily working on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/trax/tree/master/trax/rl"&gt;rl&lt;/a&gt; part,
so expect these parts to change over the next few months. We are also working hard
to improve our documentation and examples and we welcome help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer an automated installer for a bunch of different Linux distributions including Debian, Arch/Manjaro and Fedora. It can be ran via&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo bash scripts/install.sh&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the project root directory. If you are interested in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder#manual-installation"&gt;manual way of installation&lt;/a&gt;, check below instructions. To then finally run the application see &lt;a href="https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder#running"&gt;Running&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are required for the project, and can usually be downloaded via your distribution-specific package manager:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt install libsfml-dev                &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/span&gt;
sudo pacman -S sfml                         &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Arch/Manjaro&lt;/span&gt;
sudo yum install sfml-devel                 &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Fedora/RHEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project uses CMake to create the build files. You can install the tool using your package manager:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt install cmake  &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Debian&lt;/span&gt;
sudo pacman -S cmake    &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Arch/Manjaro&lt;/span&gt;
sudo yum install cmake  &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Fedora/RHEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First clone the project and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;git clone https://github.com/Hopson97/open-builder.git
&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; open-builder&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build, at the root of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sh scripts/build.sh&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-running" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#running"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Running&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run, at the root of the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sh scripts/run.sh               &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Launches both client and server  &lt;/span&gt;
sh scripts/run.sh -server 8     &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Launches server only, allowing upto 8 connections&lt;/span&gt;
sh scripts/run.sh -client xyz   &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Launches client, with player name xyz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build and run in release mode, simply add the &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; suffix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sh scripts/build.sh release
sh scripts/run.sh release &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;args&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, this was going to be a Zombie game, but I got very bored of that very quickly, and so changed the project to be a voxel game instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this, the code was created for the zombie game, so when I decided to switch over, the code got messy very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat this, I did a massive refactor in just over 2 weeks, re-creating large parts of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is DevOps?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"DevOps describes approaches to speeding up the processes by which an idea (like a new software feature, a request for enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. These approaches require that development teams and operations teams communicate frequently and approach their work with empathy for their teammates. Scalability and flexible provisioning are also necessary. With DevOps, those that need power the most, get it—through self service and automation. Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to speed software builds, tests, and releases—without sacrificing reliability."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the benefits of DevOps? What it can help us to achieve?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should mention some or all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure to elaborate :)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not allowing to push in production on Friday :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One specific person is in charge of different tasks. For example there is only one person who is allowed to merge the code of everyone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Treating production differently from development environment. For example, not implementing security in development environment
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Continuous Integration?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Continuous Deployment?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Continuous Delivery?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What CI/CD best practices are you familiar with? Or what do you consider as CI/CD best practice?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What systems and/or tools are you using for the following?:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioning infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring &amp;amp; alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioning infrastructure - Terraform, CloudFormation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration Management - Ansible, Puppet, Chef&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring &amp;amp; alerting - Prometheus, Nagios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code review - Gerrit, Review Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your answer you can mention one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mature vs. cutting edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes are applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time
the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples to tools which
follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually new infrastructure. So a change
to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology
which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it's RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is caching? How it works? Why is it important?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain stateless vs. stateful&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stateless applications don't store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices.
Stateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain "Open Source"&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe me the architecture of service/app/project/... you designed and/or implemented&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of tests are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Styling, unit, functional, API, integration, smoke, scenario, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You should be able to explain those that you mention.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You need to install periodically the same package on different operating systems (Ubuntu, RHEL, ...). How would you do it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It can be as simple as one Ansible (or other CM tool) task that runs periodically with Cron. In more advanced cases, perhaps a CI system.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Compare SRE to DevOps&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Reliability? How does it fit DevOps?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliability, when used in DevOps context, is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure failure or disruption. Part of it is also being able to scale based on your organization or team demands.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What SRE team is responsible for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One can argue whether it's per company definition or a global one but at least according to a large companies, like Google for example, the SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their services
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an error budget?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are MTTF (mean time to failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair)? What these metrics help us to evaluate?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a post-mortem meeting? Why is it important?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is "infrastructure as code"? What implementation of IAC are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you manage build artifacts?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What Continuous Integration solution are you using/prefer and why?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What deployment strategies are you familiar with or have used?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Tell me how you perform plan capacity for your CI/CD resources (e.g. servers, storage, etc.)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you structure/implement CD for an application which depends on several other applications?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you measure your CI/CD quality? Are there any metrics or KPIs you are using for measuring the quality?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server
or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don't get and over time these servers become
slightly different than all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to deal with a configuration drift?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Do you have experience with testing cross-projects changes? (aka cross-dependency)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: cross-dependency is when you have two or more changes to separate projects and you would like to test them in mutual build instead of testing each change separately.

&lt;summary&gt;What is Jenkins? What have you used it for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the advantages of Jenkins over its competitors? Can you compare it to one of the following systems?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bamboo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teamcity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CircleCI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the limitations or disadvantages of Jenkins?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What plugins have you used in Jenkins?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain CI/CD and how you implemented it in Jenkins&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What type of jobs are there? Which types have you used?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How did you report build results to users? What ways are you familiar with for reporting results?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You need to run unit tests every time a change submitted to a given project. Describe in details how your pipeline would look like and what will be executed in each stage&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to secure Jenkins?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Can you describe some of Jenkins best practices?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe how do you add new slaves to Jenkins&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can describe the UI way to add new slaves but better to explain how to do in a way that scales like a script or using dynamic source for slaves like one of the existing clouds.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;How to acquire multiple slaves for one specific build?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;There are four teams in your organization. How to prioritize the builds of each team? So the jobs of team x will always run before team y for example&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;If you are managing a dozen of jobs, you can probably use the Jenkins UI. How do you manage the creation and deletion of hundreds of jobs every week/month?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are some of Jenkins limitations?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing cross-dependencies (changes from multiple projects together)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting builds from any stage (although cloudbees implemented something called checkpoints)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you implement an option of a starting a build from a certain stage and not from the beginning?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Cloud Computing? What is a Cloud Provider?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the advantages of cloud computing? Mention at least 3 advantages&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay as you go (or consumption-based payment) - you are paying only for what you are using. No upfront payments and payment stops when resources are no longer used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scalable - resources are scaled down or up based on demand
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of Cloud Computing are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IAAS
PAAS
SAAS
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain each of the following Cloud Computing Deployments:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the differences between Cloud Providers and On-Premise solution?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cloud providers, someone else owns and manages the hardware, hire the relevant infrastructure teams and pays for real-estate (for both hardware and people). You can focus on your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In On-Premise solution, it's quite the opposite. You need to take care of hardware, infrastructure teams and pay for everything which can be quite expensive. On the other hand it's tailored to your needs.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Serverless Computing?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea behind serverless computing is that you don't need to manage the creation and configuration of server. All you need to focus on is splitting your app into multiple functions which will be triggered by some actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serverless Computing is still using servers. So saying there are no servers in serverless computing is completely wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Serverless Computing allows you to have different paying model. You basically pay only when your functions are running and not when the VM or containers are running as in other payment models
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Availability zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge location&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
AWS regions are data centers hosted across different geographical locations worldwide, each region is completely independent of one another.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within each region, there are multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Multiple availability zones ensure high availability in case one of them goes down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edge locations are basically content delivery network which caches data and insures lower latency and faster delivery to the users in any location. They are located in major cities in the world.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is S3 and what is it used for&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
S3 stands for 3 S, Simple Storage Service.
S3 is a object storage service which is fast, scalable and durable. S3 enables customers to upload, download or store any file or object that is up to 5 TB in size. While having a maximum size of 5 GB per file (multipart upload if more than 5 GB in size).
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a bucket?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
An S3 bucket is a resource which is similar to folders in a file system and allows storing objects, which consist of data and its  meta data.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? A bucket name must be globally unique&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
True
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What objects in S3 consists of?
  * Another way to ask it: explain key, value, version id and meta data in context of objects&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can confirm your suspicion by going to AWS Redshift console and see running queries graph. This should tell you if there are any long-running queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If confirmed, you can query for running queries and cancel the irrelevant queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for connection leaks (query for running connections and include their IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check for table locks and kill irrelevant locking sessions

&lt;summary&gt;What is Ethernet?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a MAC address? What is it used for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an IP address?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain subnet mask and given an example&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a private IP address? What do we need it for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the OSI model. What layers there are? What each layer is responsible for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application: user end (HTTP is here)
Presentation: establishes context between application-layer entities (Encryption is here)
Session: establishes, manages and terminates the connections
Transport: transfers variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host (TCP &amp;amp; UDP are here)
Network: transfers datagrams from one network to another (IP is here)
Data link: provides a link between two directly connected nodes (MAC is here)
Physical: the electrical and physical spec the data connection (Bits are here)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;For each of the following determine to which OSI layer it belongs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packets routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cables and electrical signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MAC address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sessions between applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 way handshake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What delivery schemes are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unitcast: One to one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting.
Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multicast: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSMA/CD algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are waiting for a random time before sending again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe the following network devices and the difference between them:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;router&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hub&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How does a router works?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is NAT?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a proxy? How it works? What do we need it for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How does SSL handshake work?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between TCP and UDP?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between client and server and doesn't handle package order. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for streaming services.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? TCP is better than UDP&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What TCP/IP protocols are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is IPv6? Why should we consider using it if we have IPv4?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is VLAN?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is MTU?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False?. Ping is using UDP because it doesn't care about reliable connection&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is your experience with Linux?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open question. Answer based on your real experience. You can highlight one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting &amp;amp; Debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deployments
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what each of the following commands does and give an example on how to use it:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rmdir (can you achieve the same result by using &lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nslookup or dig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;df&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ls - list files and directories. You can highlight common flags like -d, -a, -l, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rm - remove files and directories. You should mention -r for recursive removal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rmdir - remove directories but you should mention it's possible to use rm for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grep - print lines that match patterns. Could be nice to mention -v, -r, -E flags&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wc - print newline, word, and byte counts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;curl - tranfer a URL or mention common usage like downloading files, API calls, ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch - update timestamps but common usage is to create files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;man - reference manuals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nslookup or dig - query nameservers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;df - provides info regarding file system disk space usage
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Running the command &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; you get "command not found". What could be wrong and how to fix it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Most likely the default/generated $PATH was somehow modified or overridden thus not containing &lt;code&gt;/bin/&lt;/code&gt; where df would normally go.
This issue could also happen if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified, causing erratics behaviours.
You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As to fix it there are serveral options:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually adding what you need to your $PATH &lt;code&gt;PATH="$PATH":/user/bin:/..etc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have your weird env variables backed up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You would look for your distro default $PATH variable, copy paste using method #1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: There are many ways of getting errors like this: if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified; causing erratics behaviours,
permissions issues, bad compiled software (if you compiled it by yourself)... there is no answer that will be true 100% of the time.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you schedule tasks periodically?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the commands &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;.
With cron, tasks are scheduled using the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*/30 * * * * bash myscript.sh&lt;/code&gt; Executes the script every 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tasks are stored in a cron file, you can write in it using &lt;code&gt;crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively if you are using a distro with systemd it's recommended to use systemd timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Have you scheduled tasks in the past? What kind of tasks?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Normally you will schedule batch jobs.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-permissions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#permissions"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Permissions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to change the permissions of a file?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What does the following permissions mean?:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;777&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;644&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;750&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;777 - You give the owner, group and other: Execute (1), Write (2) and Read (4); 4+2+1 = 7.
644 - Owner has Read (4), Write (2), 4+2 = 6; Group and Other have Read (4).
750 - Owner has x+r+w, Group has Read (4) and Execute (1); 4+1 = 5. Other have no permissions.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is setgid, setuid and sticky bit&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You try to delete a file but it fails. Name at least three different reason as to why it could happen&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more disk space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more indoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No permissions
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is systemd?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
Systemd is a daemon (System 'd', d stands from daemon).
&lt;p&gt;A daemon is a program that runs in the background without direct control of the user, although the user can at any time
talk to the daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;systemd has many features such as user processes control/tracking, snapshot support, inhibitor locks..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we visualize the unix/linux system in layers, systemd would fall directly after the linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hardware -&amp;gt; Kernel -&amp;gt; Daemons, System Libraries, Server Display.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;On a system which uses systemd, how would you display the logs?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;journalctl&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What are you using for troubleshooting and debugging &lt;b&gt;network&lt;/b&gt; issues?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;dstat -t&lt;/code&gt; is great for identifying network and disk issues.
&lt;code&gt;netstat -tnlaup&lt;/code&gt; can be used to see which processes are running on which ports.
&lt;code&gt;lsof -i -P&lt;/code&gt; can be used for the same purpose as netstat.
&lt;code&gt;ngrep -d any metafilter&lt;/code&gt; for matching regex against payloads of packets.
&lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; for capturing packets
&lt;code&gt;wireshark&lt;/code&gt; same concept as tcpdump but with GUI (optional).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are you using for troubleshooting and debugging &lt;b&gt;disk &amp;amp; file system&lt;/b&gt; issues?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;dstat -t&lt;/code&gt; is great for identifying network and disk issues.
&lt;code&gt;opensnoop&lt;/code&gt; can be used to see which files are being opened on the system (in real time).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are you using for troubleshooting and debugging &lt;b&gt;process&lt;/b&gt; issues?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; is great for understanding what your program does. It prints every system call your program executed.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are you using for debugging CPU related issues?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; will show you how much CPU percentage each process consumes
&lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt; is a great choice for sampling profiler and in general, figuring out what your CPU cycles are "wasted" on
&lt;code&gt;flamegraphs&lt;/code&gt; is great for CPU consumption visualization (&lt;a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You get a call from someone claiming "my system is SLOW". What do yo do?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check with &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; for anything unusual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;dstat -t&lt;/code&gt; to check if it's related to disk or network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if it's network related with &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check I/O stats with &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exit code (or return code) represents the code returned by a child process to its
parent process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 is an exit code which represents success while anything higher than 1 represents error.
Each number has different meaning, based on how the application was developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I consider this as a good blog post to read more about it: &lt;a href="https://shapeshed.com/unix-exit-codes" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://shapeshed.com/unix-exit-codes&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What's an inode?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For each file (and directory) in Linux there is an inode, a data structure which stores meta data
related to the file like its size, owner, permissions, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Which of the following is not included in inode:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File timestamp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;How to check which disks are currently mounted?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between a soft link and hard link?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard link is the same file, using the same inode.
Soft link is a shortcut to another file, using a different inode.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? You can create an hard link for a directory&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? You can create a soft link between different filesystems&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;True
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What happens when you delete the original file in case of soft link and hard link?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You are trying to create a new file but you get "File system is full". You check with df for free space and you see you used only 20% of the space. What could be the problem?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to run a process in the background and why to do that in the first place?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can achieve that by specifying &amp;amp; at end of the command.
As to why, since some commands/processes can take a lot of time to finish
execution or run forever
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How can you find how much memory a specific process consumes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What signal is used by default when you run 'kill *process id*'?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;The default signal is SIGTERM (15). This signal kills
process gracefully which means it allows it to save current
state configuration.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What signals are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIGTERM - default signal for terminating a process
SIGHUP - common usage is for reloading configuration
SIGKILL - a signal which cannot caught or ignored&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To view all available signals run &lt;code&gt;kill -l&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What &lt;code&gt;kill 0&lt;/code&gt; does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What &lt;code&gt;kill -0 &lt;/code&gt; does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the possible states of a process in Linux?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Running (R)
Uninterruptible Sleep (D) - The process is waiting for I/O
Interruptible Sleep (S)
Stopped (T)
Dead (x)
Zombie (z)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a zombie process?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process which has finished to run but has not exited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One reason it happens is when a parent process is programmed incorrectly. Every parent process should execute wait() to get the exit code from the child process which finished to run. But when the parent isn't checking for the child exit code, the child process can still exists although it finished to run.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to get rid of zombie processes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't kill a zombie process the regular way with &lt;code&gt;kill -9&lt;/code&gt; for example as it's already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to kill zombie process is by sending SIGCHLD to the parent process telling it to terminate its child processes. This might not work if the parent process wasn't programmed properly. The invocation is &lt;code&gt;kill -s SIGCHLD [parent_pid]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can also try closing/terminating the parent process. This will make the zombie process a child of init (1) which does periodic cleanups and will at some point clean up the zombie process.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to find all the

&lt;li&gt;Process which are Java processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zombie Processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you mention at any point ps command with arugments, be familiar with what these arguments does exactly.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the init process?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Find all the files which end with '.yml' and replace the number 1 in 2 in each file&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;find /some_dir -iname *.yml -print0 | xargs -0 -r sed -i "s/1/2/g"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to check how much free memory a system has? How to check memory consumption by each process?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can use the commands &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You run ls and you get "/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 no such file or directory". What is the problem?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ls executable is built for an incompatible architecture.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you split a 50 lines file into 2 files of 25 lines each?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; command this way: &lt;code&gt;split -l 25 some_file&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a file descriptor? What file descriptors are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Kerberos
File descriptor, also known as file handler, is a unique number which identifies an open file in the operating system.
&lt;p&gt;In Linux (and Unix) the first three file descriptors are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0 - the default data stream for input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 - the default data stream for output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 - the default data stream for output related to errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a great article on the topic: &lt;a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the fork system call&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;fork() is used for creating a new process. It does so by cloning the calling process but the child process has its own PID and any memory locks, I/O operations and semaphores are not inherited.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the exec system call&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the differences between exec() and fork()?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Why do we need the wait system call?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;wait() is used by a parent process to wait for the child process to finish execution.
If wait is not used by a parent process then a child process might become a zombie process.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What execve() does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Executes a program. The program is passed as a filename (or path) and must be a binary executable or a script.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What happens when you execute &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell reads the input using getline() which reads the input file stream and stores into a buffer as a string&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buffer is broken down into tokens and stored in an array this way: {"ls", "-l", "NULL"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell checks if an expansion is required (in case of ls *.c)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the program in memory, its execution starts. First by calling readdir()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;getline() originates in GNU C library and used to read lines from input stream and stores those lines in the buffer
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What happens when you execute &lt;code&gt;ls -l *.log&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What readdir() system call does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;fallocate -l 2097152 new_file.txt
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you describe how processes are being created?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What does the following block do?:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;open("/my/file") = 5
read(5, "file content")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These system calls are reading the file &lt;code&gt;/my/file&lt;/code&gt; and 5 is the file descriptor number.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is an operating system?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to answer that. For those who look for simplicity, the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" offers nice version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-processes-1" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#processes-1"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Processes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you explain what is a process?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A process is a running program. A program is one or more instructions and the program (or process) is executed by the operating system.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would support the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create - allow to create new processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stop - allow to stop a running process
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How a process is created?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program's bytes are loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for data structures like linked lists and hash tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I/O initialization tasks like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS is running the program, strarting from main()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: The loading of the program's code into the memory done lazily which means the OS loads only partial relevant pieces required for the process to run and not the entire code.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are different states of a process?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running - it's executing instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buffer: Reserved place in RAM which is used to hold data for temporary purposes
Cache: Cache is usually used when processes reading and writing to the disk to make the process faster by making similar data used by different programs easily accessible.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is "time sharing"?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is "space sharing"?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way it's not being transfered between them.&lt;br&gt;
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is your until you decide to delete it.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Task – a call to a specific Ansible module
Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred as task plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How Ansible is different from other Automation tools?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agent-less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal run requirements (Python &amp;amp; SSH) and simple to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default mode is "push" (it supports also pull)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on simpleness and ease-of-use
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What kind of automation you wouldn't do with Ansible and why?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an inventory file and how do you define one?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of inventory file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4

[web_servers]
190.40.2.20
190.40.2.21
190.40.2.22
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically&lt;br&gt;
spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you list all modules and how can you see details on a specific module?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ansible online docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible-doc -l&lt;/code&gt; for list of modules and &lt;code&gt;ansible [module_name]&lt;/code&gt; for detailed information on a specific module
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a task to create the directory ‘/tmp/new_directory’&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Create a new directory
  file:
    path: "/tmp/new_directory"
    state: directory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You want to run Ansible playbook only on specific minor version of your OS, how would you achieve that?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What would be the result of the following play?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
- name: Print information about my host
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: 'no'                                                                                                                                                                           
  tasks:
      - name: Print hostname
        debug:
            msg: "It's me, {{ ansible_hostname }}"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When given a written code, always inspect it thoroughly. If your answer is “this will fail” then you are right. We are using a fact (ansible_hostname), which is a gathered piece of information from the host we are running on. But in this case, we disabled facts gathering (gather_facts: no) so the variable would be undefined which will result in failure.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What would be the result of running the following task?
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
      - name: Install zlib
        package:
          name: zlib
          state: present
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Which Ansible best practices are you familiar with?. Name at least three&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the directory layout of an Ansible role&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a playbook to install ‘zlib’ and ‘vim’ on all hosts if the file ‘/tmp/mario’ exists on the system.&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
- hosts: all
  vars:
      mario_file: /tmp/mario
      package_list:
          - 'zlib' 
          - 'vim'
  tasks:
      - name: Check for mario file
        stat:
            path: "{{ mario_file }}"
        register: mario_f

      - name: Install zlib and vim if mario file exists
        become: "yes"
        package:
            name: "{{ item }}"
            state: present
        with_items: "{{ package_list }}"
        when: mario_f.stat.exists
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a playbook to deploy the file ‘/tmp/system_info’ on all hosts except for controllers group, with the following content&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I'm &amp;lt;HOSTNAME&amp;gt; and my operating system is &amp;lt;OS&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace  and   with the actual data for the specific host you are running on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The playbook to deploy the system_info file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- 
- name: Deploy /tmp/system_info file
  hosts: all:!controllers
  tasks: 
      - name: Deploy /tmp/system_info
        template:
            src: system_info.j2 
            dest: /tmp/system_info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the system_info.j2 template&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# {{ ansible_managed }}
I'm {{ ansible_hostname }} and my operating system is {{ ansible_distribution }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;The variable 'whoami' defined in the following places:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;role defaults -&amp;gt; whoami: mario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extra vars (variables you pass to Ansible CLI with -e) -&amp;gt; whoami: toad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;host facts -&amp;gt; whoami: luigi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inventory variables (doesn’t matter which type) -&amp;gt; whoami: browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to variable precedence, which one will be used?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right answer is ‘toad’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variable precedence is about how variables override each other when they set in different locations. If you didn’t experience it so far I’m sure at some point you will, which makes it a useful topic to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of our question, the order will be extra vars (always override any other variable) -&amp;gt; host facts -&amp;gt; inventory variables -&amp;gt; role defaults (the weakest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A full list can be found at the link above. Also, note there is a significant difference between Ansible 1.x and 2.x.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;For each of the following statements determine if it's true or false:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A module is a collection of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s better to use shell or command instead of a specific module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host facts override play variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A role might include the following: vars, meta, and handlers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic inventory is generated by extracting information from external sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s a best practice to use indention of 2 spaces instead of 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘notify’ used to trigger handlers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This “hosts: all:!controllers” means ‘run only on controllers group hosts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is ansible-pull? How is it different from how ansible-playbook works?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Ansible Vault?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Demonstrate each of the following with Ansible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditionals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What are filters? Do you have experience with writing filters?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a filter to capitalize a string&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;You would like to run a task only if previous task changed anything. How would you achieve that?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Can you explain what is Terraform? How it works?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#what-is-terraform-" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fully automated process of provisioning, modifying and deleting your infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;version control for your infrastructure which allows you to quickly rollback to previous versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;validate infrastructure quality and stability with automated tests and code reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;makes infrastructure tasks less repetitive
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools
and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn't mean Ansible and Puppet can't
be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn't explain why Terraform should be used over
CloudFormation if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declarative since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In Terraform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server so you need to explicitly make sure you provision only another one server.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is "Terraform configuration"&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
A configuration is a root module along with a tree of child modules that are called as dependencies from the root module.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is HCL?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
HCL stands for Hashicorp Conviguration Language. It is the language Hashicorp made to use as the configuration language for a number of its tools, including terraform.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain each of the following:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  * Provider is any cloud based technology - github, aws, postgresql etc - which one can make an API call to with its unique terraform provider binary to provision available services and components.&lt;br&gt;  
  * Resources are the services and components you provision on these platforms.&lt;br&gt;
  * Provisioner in terraform's lingo specifically refers to configuration tools like ansible or salt-stack which are used in combination with terraform to orchestrate a system.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What &lt;code&gt;terraform.tfstate&lt;/code&gt; file is used for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; 
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It keeps track of the IDs of created resources so that Terraform knows what it is managing.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what the following commands do:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform validate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;terraform init&lt;/code&gt; scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them.
&lt;code&gt;terraform plan&lt;/code&gt; will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it.
&lt;code&gt;terraform validate&lt;/code&gt; checks if configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent within a directory.
&lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt; will provision the resources specified in the .tf files.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to write down a variable which changes by an external source or during &lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You use it this way: &lt;code&gt;variable “my_var” {}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Give an example of several Terraform best practices&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain how implicit and explicit dependencies work in Terraform&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;local-exec&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;remote-exec&lt;/code&gt; in the context of provisioners?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a "tainted resource"?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's a resource which was successfully created but failed during provisioning. Terraform will fail and mark this resource as "tainted".
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What &lt;code&gt;terraform taint&lt;/code&gt; does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of variables are supported in Terraform?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;string
number
bool
list()
set()
map()
object({&amp;lt;ATTR_NAME&amp;gt; = , ... })
tuple([, ...])
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a data source? In what scenarios for example would need to use it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Data sources lookup or compute values that can be used elsewhere in terraform configuration.
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few cases you might need to use them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to reference resources not managed through terraform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to reference resources managed by a different terraform module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;you want to cleanly compute a value with typechecking, such as with &lt;code&gt;aws_iam_policy_document&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are output variables and what &lt;code&gt;terraform output&lt;/code&gt; does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Output variables are named values that are sourced from the attributes of a module. They are stored in terraform state, and can be used by other modules through &lt;code&gt;remote_state&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Modules&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the Terraform Registry?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain &lt;code&gt;remote-exec&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;local-exec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="user-content-terraform-advanced"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-star-advanced-5" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#star-advanced-5"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="star" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b50.png"&gt;⭐️&lt;/g-emoji&gt; Advanced&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain "Remote State". When would you use it and how?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  Terraform generates a `terraform.tfstate` json file that describes components/service provisioned on the specified provider. Remote  
  State stores this file in a remote storage media to enable collaboration amongst team.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain "State Locking"&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  State locking is a mechanism that blocks an operations against a specific state file from multiple callers so as to avoid conflicting operations from different team members. Once the first caller's operation's lock is released the other team member may go ahead to   
  carryout his own operation. Nevertheless Terraform will first check the state file to see if the desired resource already exist and 
  if not it goes ahead to create it.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the "Random" provider? What is it used for&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
 The random provider aids in generating numeric or alphabetic characters to use as a prefix or suffix for a desired named identifier.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you test a terraform module?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  Many examples are acceptable, but the most common answer would likely to be using the tool &lt;code&gt;terratest&lt;/code&gt;, and to test that a module can be initialized, can create resources, and can destroy those resources cleanly.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Aside from &lt;code&gt;.tfvars&lt;/code&gt; files or CLI arguments, how can you inject dependencies from other modules?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  The built-in terraform way would be to use &lt;code&gt;remote-state&lt;/code&gt; to lookup the outputs from other modules.
  It is also common in the community to use a tool called &lt;code&gt;terragrunt&lt;/code&gt; to explicitly inject variables between modules.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Docker? What are you using it for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How containers are different from VMs?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to virtualize
multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the hardware is being virtualized to
run multiple machines each with its own OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containers don't require an entire guest operating system as VMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's usually takes a few seconds to set up a container as opposed to VMs which can take minutes or at least more time than containers as there is an entire OS to boot and initialize as opposed to container where you mainly lunch the app itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Docker is one of the technologies allowing you to manage containers - run multiple containers on a host, move containers between hosts, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should choose VMs when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalities of an OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need full isolation and security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should choose containers when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need a lightweight solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Running multiple versions or instances of a single application
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Docker architecture&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe in detail what happens when you run `docker run hello-world`?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Docker CLI passes your request to Docker daemon.
Docker daemon downloads the image from Docker Hub
Docker daemon creates a new container by using the image it downloaded
Docker daemon redirects output from container to Docker CLI which redirects it to the standard output
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you run a container?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;docker run
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What `docker commit` does?. When will you use it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a new image from a container’s changes
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you transfer data from one container into another?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What happens to data of the container when a container exists?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what each of the following commands do:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker rm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker ps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker pull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docker commit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you remove old, non running, containers?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To remove one or more Docker images use the docker container rm command followed by the ID of the containers you want to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The docker system prune command will remove all stopped containers, all dangling images, and all unused networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) - This command will delete all stopped containers. The command docker ps -a -q will return all existing container IDs and pass them to the rm command which will delete them. Any running containers will not be deleted.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-dockerfile" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dockerfile"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Dockerfile&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Dockerfile?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker image) into the Docker image itself.
ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. That’s because it’s more transparent than ADD. COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container, while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between CMD and RUN in Dockerfile?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RUN lets you execute commands inside of your Docker image. These commands get executed once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer.
CMD is the command the container executes by default when you launch the built image. A Dockerfile can only have one CMD.
You could say that CMD is a Docker run-time operation, meaning it’s not something that gets executed at build time. It happens when you run an image. A running image is called a container.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Do you perform any checks or testing related to your Dockerfile?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A common answer to this is to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint"&gt;hadolint&lt;/a&gt; project which is a linter based on Dockerfile best practices.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is Docker compose and what is it used for&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the differences between Docker compose, Docker swarm and Kubernetes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Docker interlock&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between Docker Hub and Docker cloud?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker Hub is a native Docker registry service which allows you to run pull
and push commands to install and deploy Docker images from the Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Docker Cloud is built on top of the Docker Hub so Docker Cloud provides
you with more options/features compared to Docker Hub. One example is
Swarm management which means you can create new swarms in Docker Cloud.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Where Docker images are stored?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
In DockerHub
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain image layers&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Docker image is built up from a series of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile. Each layer except the very last one is read-only.
Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it. The layers are stacked on top of each other. When you create a new container, you add a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. This layer is often called the “container layer”. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer.
The major difference between a container and an image is the top writable layer. All writes to the container that add new or modify existing data are stored in this writable layer. When the container is deleted, the writable layer is also deleted. The underlying image remains unchanged.
Because each container has its own writable container layer, and all changes are stored in this container layer, multiple containers can share access to the same underlying image and yet have their own data state.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Kubernetes? What use cases is it good for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what Kubernetes is good for, let's look at some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would like to run a certain application in a container on multiple different locations. Sure, if it's 2-3 servers/locations, you can do it by yourself but it can be challenging to scale. Also, running them is not only running the container but also react on different events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing updates and changes across hundreds of containers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handle cases where the current load requires to scale up (or down)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe the architecture of Kubernetes&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a Kubernetes Cluster?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cluster consists of a Master (which coordinates the cluster) and Nodes where the applications are running.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What the Master is responsible for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master coordinates all the workflows in the cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing desired state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rolling out new updates
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a Node?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A node is a virtual machine or a physical server that serves as a worker for running the applications.
It's recommended to have at least 3 nodes in Kubernetes production environment.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is Kubelet&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kubelet is an agent running on each node and responsible for node communication with the master.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Minikube?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation. It create a local virtual machine and deploys a simple (single node) cluster.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is a Kubernetes pod&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? A pod can manage multiple containers&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you monitor your Kubernetes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You suspect one of the pods is having issues, what do you do?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by inspecting the pods status. we can use the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/code&gt; (--all-namespaces for pods in system namespace)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we see "Error" status, we can keep debugging by running the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe pod [name]&lt;/code&gt;. In case we still don't see anything useful we can try stern for log tailing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case we find out there was a temporary issue with the pod or the system, we can try restarting the pod with the following &lt;code&gt;kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting the replicas to 0 will shut down the process. Now start it with &lt;code&gt;kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=1&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What the Kubernetes Scheduler does?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What happens to running pods if if you stop Kubelet on the worker nodes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe how roll-back works&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-kubernetes-commands" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#kubernetes-commands"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kubernetes Commands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is kubectl?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the cluster status?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the status of the nodes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What the following commands do?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kubectl get nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kubectl &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What programming language do you prefer to use for DevOps related tasks? Why specifically this one?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain expressions and statements&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expression is anything that results in a value (even if the value is None). Basically, any sequence of literals so, you can say that a string, integer, list, ... are all expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statements are instructions executed by the interpreter like variable assignments, for loops and conditionals (if-else).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Object Oriented Programming? Why is it important?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Are you familiar with SOLID design principals?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOLID design principals are about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easier to extend the functionality of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the code more readable and easier to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOLID is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single Responsibility - A class should only have a single responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open-Closed - An entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification. What this practically means is that you should extend functionality by adding a new code and not by modifying it. Your system should be separated into components so it can be easily extended without breaking everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liskov Substitution - Any derived class should be able to substitute the its parent without altering its corrections. Practically, every part of the code will get the expected result no matter which part is using it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface segregation - A client should never depend on anything it doesn't uses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dependency Inversion - High level modules should depend on abstractions, not low level modules
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Inversion of Control&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Dependency Injection&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what are design patterns and describe three of them in detail&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain big O notation&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Binary search:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How it works?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you implement it? (in any language you prefer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the average performance of the algorithm you wrote?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a search algorithm used with sorted arrays/lists to find a target value by dividing the array each iteration and comparing the middle value to the target value. If the middle value is smaller than target value, then the target value is searched in the right part of the divided array, else in the left side. This continues until the value is found (or the array divided max times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="coding/python/binary_search.py"&gt;python implementation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The average performance of the above algorithm is O(log n). Best performance can be O(1) and worst O(log n).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What are your code-review best practices?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Do you agree/disagree with each of the following statements and why?:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The commit message is not important. When reviewing a change/patch one should focus on the actual change&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are some characteristics of the Python programming language?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python package manager is called PIP "pip installs packages", having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

There are many other characteristics but these are the main ones that every python programmer should know.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What built-in types Python has?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List
Dictionary
Set
Numbers (int, float, ...)
String
Bool
Tuple
Frozenset
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is mutability? Which of the built-in types in Python are mutable? How can you show that a certain data type is mutable?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutability determines whether you can modify an object of specific type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutable data types are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List
Dictionary
Set
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immutable data types are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Numbers (int, float, ...)
String
Bool
Tuple
Frozenset
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can usually use the function hash() to check an object mutability. If an object is hashable, it is immutable (although this does not always work as intended as user defined objects might be mutable and hashable).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;In Python, functions are first-class objects. What does it mean?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, first class objects in programming languages are objects which can be assigned to variable, used as a return value and can be used as arguments or parameters.&lt;br&gt;
In python you can treat functions this way. Let's say we have the following function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def my_function():
    return 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can then assign a function to a variables like this &lt;code&gt;x = my_function&lt;/code&gt; or you can return functions as return values like this &lt;code&gt;return my_function&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the result of running &lt;code&gt;[] is not []&lt;/code&gt;? explain the result&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It evaluates to True.&lt;br&gt;
The reason is that the two created empty list are different objects. &lt;code&gt;x is y&lt;/code&gt; only evaluates to true when x and y are the same object.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My name is  Michael
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I'm alive!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ñom ñom ñom Spam
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; My name is Bruno
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; and I'm alive!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ñom ñom ñom bone
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain and demonstrate class attributes &amp;amp; instance attributes&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following block of code &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a class attribute while &lt;code&gt;self.y&lt;/code&gt; is a instance attribute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class MyClass(object):
    x = 1

    def __init__(self, y):
        self.y = y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.
    
    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)
           
               for i in 'foo'
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
        We missed ':'
        
        
        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)
          
                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
        
    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.
    
    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.
    
    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:
        
        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...
    
    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:
        
    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message
    
    
    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor
    
    division(100, 2)
    
    &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Exception Handling and how to use it in Python&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What _ is used for in Python?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation lookup in i18n&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the result of the last executed expression or statement in the interactive interpreter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name. For example: x, y, _ = get_data() (x and y are used but since we don't care about third variable, we "threw it away").
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Write a function to return the sum of one or more numbers. The user will decide how many numbers to use&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you ask the user for the amount of numbers that will be use. Use a while loop that runs until amount_of_numbers becomes 0 through subtracting amount_of_numbers by one each loop. In the while loop you want ask the user for a number which will be added a variable each time the loop runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def return_sum():

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted(some_list, reverse=True)[:3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;some_list.sort(reverse=True)
some_list[:3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;How to sort list by the length of items?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted_li = sorted(li, key=len)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or without creating a new list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;li.sort(key=len)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Do you know what is the difference between list.sort() and sorted(list)?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorted(list) will return a new list (original list doesn't change)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;list.sort() will return None but the list is change in-place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sorted() works on any iterable (Dictionaries, Strings, ...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;list.sort() is faster than sorted(list) in case of Lists
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Convert every string to an integer: &lt;code&gt;[['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6']]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nested_li = [['1', '2', '3'], ['4', '5', '6']]
[[int(x) for x in li] for li in nested_li]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;How to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sorted(li1 + li2) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;i, j = 0
merged_li = []

while i &amp;lt; len(li1) and j &amp;lt; len(li2):
    if li1[i] &amp;lt; li2[j]:
        merged_li.append(li1[i])
        i += 1
    else:
        merged_li.append(li2[j])
        j += 1

merged_li = merged_li + merged_li[i:] + merged_li[j:] 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to check if all the elements in a given lists are unique? so [1, 2, 3] is unique but [1, 1, 2, 3] is not unique because 1 exists twice&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways of solving this problem:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Note: :list and -&amp;gt; bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of sets and len:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_unique(l:list) -&amp;gt; bool:
    return len(set(l)) == len(l)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is can be seen used in other programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_unique2(l:list) -&amp;gt; bool:
    seen = []

    for i in l:
        if i in seen:
            return False
        seen.append(i)
    return True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we just count and make sure every element is just repeated once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_unique3(l:list) -&amp;gt; bool:
    for i in l:
        if l.count(i) &amp;gt; 1:
            return False
    return True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one might look more convulated but hey, one liners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def is_unique4(l:list) -&amp;gt; bool:
    return all(map(lambda x: l.count(x) &amp;lt; 2, l))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You have the following function
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def my_func(li = []):
    li.append("hmm")  
    print(li)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we call it 3 times, what would be the result each call?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;['hmm']
['hmm', 'hmm']
['hmm', 'hmm', 'hmm']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to iterate over a list in reverse order?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for i in reversed(li):
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;n = len(li) - 1
while n &amp;gt; 0:
    ...
    n -= 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Sort a list of lists by the second item of each nested list&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;li = [[1, 4], [2, 1], [3, 9], [4, 2], [4, 5]]

sorted(li, key=lambda l: l[1])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;li.sort(key=lambda l: l[1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Combine [1, 2, 3] and ['x', 'y', 'z'] so the result is [(1, 'x'), (2, 'y'), (3, 'z')]&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nums = [1, 2, 3]
letters = ['x', 'y', 'z']

list(zip(nums, letters))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What empty &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; returns?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer is: It returns a None object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could go a bit deeper and explain the difference between&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def a ():
    return
    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def a ():
    pass
    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we could be asked this as a following question, since they both give the same result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could use the dis module to see what's going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (&amp;lt;code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "&amp;lt;dis&amp;gt;", line 2&amp;gt;)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('a')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (a)

  5           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (&amp;lt;code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "&amp;lt;dis&amp;gt;", line 5&amp;gt;)
             10 LOAD_CONST               3 ('b')
             12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             14 STORE_NAME               1 (b)
             16 LOAD_CONST               4 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of &amp;lt;code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "&amp;lt;dis&amp;gt;", line 2&amp;gt;:
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of &amp;lt;code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "&amp;lt;dis&amp;gt;", line 5&amp;gt;:
  6           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An empty &lt;code&gt; return&lt;/code&gt; is exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;return None&lt;/code&gt; and functions without any explicit return
will always return None regardless of the operations, therefore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def sum(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b
    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; None
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What data types are you familiar with that are not Python built-in types but still provided by modules which are part of the standard library?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a good reference &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is a decorator&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments
for another function eg;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + "Ohh"
    
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; oh(wee("Wee"))
&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; Wee Ohh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper,
(a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; f = function(function_1())&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt; f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;every time, that's what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword '@'.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you show how to write and use decorators?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of
tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&amp;amp;t=3731s&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f"Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!")
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return "Hi, I'm in!"

a = hello_world()
print(a)

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I'm in!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting &lt;code&gt;a = deco(hello_world())&lt;/code&gt;.
But at this point we can only control the before execution, let's take on the after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Rick Sanchez!")
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print("I'm in!")
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f("************")
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I'm in!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deco receives a function -&amp;gt; f
wrapper receives the arguments -&amp;gt; *args, **kwargs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -&amp;gt; f(*args, **kwargs)
deco returns wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("************")

a = f()
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2.0008859634399414
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print("************")

a = f()

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;************
   ************
   ************
   ************
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a script which will determine if a given host is accessible on a given port&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Are you familiar with Dataclasses? Can you explain what are they used for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You wrote a class to represent a car. How would you compare two cars instances if two cars are equal if they have the same model and color?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Context Manager&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tell me everything you know about concurrency in Python&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the Buffer Protocol&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Descriptors&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Do you have experience with web scraping? Can you describe what have you used and for what?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you implement Linked List in Python?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you implement Linux's &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; command in Python? Bonus: implement &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; as well&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You have created a web page where a user can upload a document. But the function which reads the uploaded files, runs for a long time, based on the document size and user has to wait for the read operation to complete before he/she can continue using the web site. How can you overcome this?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How yield works exactly?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Explain monitoring. What is it? What its goal?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is wrong with the old approach of watching for a specific value and trigger an email/phone alert while value is exceeded?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This approach require from a human to always check why the value exceeded and how to handle it while today, it is more effective to notify people only when they need to take an actual action.
If the issue doesn't require any human intervention, then the problem can be fixed by some processes running in the relevant environment.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of monitoring outputs are you familiar with and/or used in the past?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alerts
Tickets
Logging
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is an Alert?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe the following Prometheus components:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push Gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alert Manager&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prometheus server responsible for scraping the storing the data&lt;br&gt;
Push gateway is used for short-lived jobs&lt;br&gt;
Alert manager is responsible for alerts ;)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git fetch&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly, git pull = git fetch + git merge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run git pull, it gets all the changes from the remote or central
repository and attaches it to your corresponding branch in your local repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;git fetch gets all the changes from the remote repository, stores the changes in
a separate branch in your local repository
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the following: &lt;code&gt;git directory&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;working directory&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;staging area&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git directory is where Git stores the meta data and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This answer taken from &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics#_the_three_states" rel="nofollow"&gt;git-scm.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to resolve git merge conflicts?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First, you open the files which are in conflict and identify what are the conflicts.
Next, based on what is accepted in your company or team, you either discuss with your
colleagues on the conflicts or resolve them by yourself
After resolving the conflicts, you add the files with `git add `
Finally, you run `git rebase --continue`
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between &lt;code&gt;git reset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt; creates a new commit which undoes the changes from last commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset&lt;/code&gt; depends on the usage, can modify the index or change the commit which the branch head
is currently pointing at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You would like to move forth commit to the top. How would you achieve that?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;git rebase&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; command
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;In what situations are you using &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What merge strategies are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioning two or three should be enough and it's probably good to mention that 'recursive' is the default one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recursive
resolve
ours
theirs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This page explains it the best: &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How can you see which changes have done before committing them?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you revert a specific file to previous commit?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout HEAD~1 -- /path/of/the/file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; directory? What can you find there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are some Git anti-patterns? Things that you shouldn't do&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not waiting to long between commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not removing the .git directory :)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you remove a remote branch?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You delete a remote branch with this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;git push origin :[branch_name]
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Are you familiar with gitattributes? When would you use it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gitattributes allow you to define attributes per pathname or path pattern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can use it for example to control endlines in files. In Windows and Unix based systems, you have different characters for new lines (\r\n and \n accordingly). So using gitattributes we can align it for both Windows and Unix with &lt;code&gt;* text=auto&lt;/code&gt; in .gitattributes for anyone working with git. This is way, if you use the Git project in Windows you'll get \r\n and if you are using Unix or Linux, you'll get \n.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you discard local file changes? (before commit)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -- &amp;lt;file_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you discard local commits?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD~1&lt;/code&gt; for removing last commit
If you would like to also discard the changes you `git reset --hard``
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? To remove a file from git but not from the filesystem, one should use &lt;code&gt;git rm &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False. If you would like to keep a file on your filesystem, use &lt;code&gt;git reset &amp;lt;file_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="user-content-git-advanced"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-star-advanced-10" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#star-advanced-10"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="star" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b50.png"&gt;⭐️&lt;/g-emoji&gt; Advanced&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Git octopus merge&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably good to mention that it's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's good for cases of merging more than one branch (and also the default of such use cases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's primarily meant for bundling topic branches together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a great article about Octopus merge: &lt;a href="http://www.freblogg.com/2016/12/git-octopus-merge.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.freblogg.com/2016/12/git-octopus-merge.html&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are some characteristics of the Go programming language?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast compile times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in concurrency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garbage collected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform independent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go also has good community.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between &lt;code&gt;var x int = 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x := 2&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With &lt;code&gt;var x int = 2&lt;/code&gt; we are setting the variable type to integer while with &lt;code&gt;x := 2&lt;/code&gt; we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? In Go we can redeclare variables and once declared we must use it.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False. We can't redeclare variables but yes, we must used declared variables.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What libraries of Go have you used?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be answered based on your usage but some examples are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;fmt - formatted I/O
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the problem with the following block of code? How to fix it?
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;func main() {
    var x float32 = 13.5
    var y int
    y = x
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;The following block of code tries to convert the integer 101 to a string but instead we get "e". Why is that? How to fix it?
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x int = 101
    var y string
    y = string(x)
    fmt.Println(y)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It looks what unicode value is set at 101 and uses it for converting the integer to a string.
If you want to get "101" you should use the package "strconv" and replace &lt;code&gt;y = string(x)&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;y = strconv.Itoa(x)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What are the advantages of MongoDB? Or in other words, why choosing MongoDB and not other implementation of NoSQL?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;In what scenarios would you prefer to use NoSQL/Mongo over SQL?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heterogeneous data which changes often&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data consistency and integrity is not top priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best if the database needs to scale rapidly
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a document? What is a collection?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an aggregator?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is better? Embedded documents or referenced?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tell me about your experience with shell scripting&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What this line in scripts mean?: &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What do you tend to include in every script you write?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments on how to run it and/or what it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding "set -e" since I want the script to exit if a certain command failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can have an entirely different answer. It's based only on your experience.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False?: when a certain command/line fails, the script, by default, will exit and will no keep running&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depends on the language and settings used.
When a script written in Bash fails to run a certain command it will keep running and will execute all other commands mentioned after the command which failed.
Most of the time we would actually want the opposite to happen. In order to make Bash exist when a specific command fails, use 'set -e' in your script.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Today we have tools and technologies like Ansible. Why would someone still use shell scripting?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The module we need doesn't exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;We are delivering the scripts to customers who don't have access to the public network and don't necessarily have Ansible installed on their systems.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what would be the result of each command:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you debug shell scripts?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer depends on the language you are using for writing your scripts. If Bash is used for example then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding -x to the script I'm running in Bash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old good way of adding echo statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Python, then using pdb is very useful.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you get input from the user in shell scripts?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using the keyword &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; so for example &lt;code&gt;read x&lt;/code&gt; will wait for user input and will store it in the variable x.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain conditionals and how do you use them&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a loop? What types of loops are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;. When do you use them if at all?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How to store the output of a command in a variable?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you check variable length?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the difference between single and double quotes?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Write a script which will list the differences between two directories&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is the ternary operator? How do you use it in bash?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short way of using if/else. An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[[ $a = 1 ]] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; b="yes, equal" || b="nope"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What does the following code do and when would you use it?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;diff &amp;lt;(ls /tmp) &amp;lt;(ls /var/tmp)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is called 'process substitution'. It provides a way to pass the output of a command to another command when using a pipe &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is not possible. It can be used when a command does not support &lt;code&gt;STDIN&lt;/code&gt; or you need the output of multiple commands.

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What does SQL stand for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured Query Language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How is SQL Different from NoSQL&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomicity&lt;/strong&gt; - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation&lt;/strong&gt; - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability&lt;/strong&gt; - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions
must be recorded in non-volatile memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to
multiple servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a Cartesian Product?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second
table. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by
calling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select * from customers &lt;strong&gt;CROSS JOIN&lt;/strong&gt; orders;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join
on two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information
to be incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

both the Customers table and Orders table

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you show which customer ordered which items?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with cat_food as ( &lt;br&gt;
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE &lt;br&gt;
From Orders &lt;br&gt;
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" &lt;br&gt;
Group by Customer_ID &lt;br&gt;
) &lt;br&gt;
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE &lt;br&gt;
From Customers c &lt;br&gt;
Inner JOIN cat_food f &lt;br&gt;
ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID &lt;br&gt;
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice,
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is XSS?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is an type of a attack when the attacker inserts browser executable code within a HTTP response. Now the injected attack is not stored in the web application, it will only affact the users who open the maliciously crafted link or third-party web page. A successful attack allows the attacker to access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test by detecting user-defined variables and how to input them. This includes hidden or non-obvious inputs such as HTTP parameters, POST data, hidden form field values, and predefined radio or selection values. You then analyze each found vector to see if their are potential vulnerabilities, then when found you craft input data with each input vector. Then you test the crafted input and see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an SQL injection? How to manage it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL injection is an attack consists of inserts either a partial or full SQL query through data input from the browser to the web application. When a successful SQL injection happens it will allow the attacker to read sensitive information stored on the database for the web application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test by using a stored procedure, so the application must be sanitize the user input to get rid of the tisk of code injection. If not then the user could enter bad SQL, that will then be executed within the procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is CSRF? How to handle CSRF?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that makes the end user to initate a unwanted action on the web application in which the user has a authenticated session, the attacker may user an email and force the end user to click on the link and that then execute malicious actions. When an CSRF attack is successful it will compromise the end user data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use OWASP ZAP to analyze a "request", and if it appears that there no protection against cross-site request forgery when the Security Level is set to 0 (the value of csrf-token is SecurityIsDisabled.) One can use data from this request to prepare a CSRF attack by using OWASP ZAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the Elastic Stack?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elastic Stack consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Hadoop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kibana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logstash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APM Server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most used projects are the Elasticserach, Logstash and Kibana. Also known as the ELK stack.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe what happens from the moment the app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in the dashboard when the Elastic stack is used&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;  
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data logged by the application is sent to Elasticsearch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logstash processes the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user creates visualizations which uses the index in elasticsearch and more specifically the data there (this is done in Kibana).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created earlier
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain what is Elasticsearch&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an Index?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.&lt;br&gt;
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is an Inverted Index?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a Document?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What reserved fields a document has?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_id&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;_type
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Mapping&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can optimize fields for partial matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can perform language-specific analysis
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Shards&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.&lt;br&gt;
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Replicas&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Can you explain Term Frequency &amp;amp; Document Frequency?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Query Context and Filter Context&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-logstash" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#logstash"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Logstash&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are Logstash plugins? What plugins types are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input Plugins - how to collect data from different sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter Plugins - processing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Output Plugins - push data to different outputs/services/platforms
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Kibana?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the official docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.&lt;br&gt;
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is DNS? What is it used for?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNS (Domain Name Systems) is a protocol used for converting domain names into IP addresses.&lt;br&gt;
As you know computer networking is done with IP addresses (layer 3 of the OSI model) but for as humans it's hard to remember IP addresses, it's much easier to remember names. This why we need something such as DNS to convert any domain name we type into an IP address. You can think on DNS as a huge phonebook or database where each corresponding name has an IP.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How DNS works?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general the process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user types an address in the web browser (some_site.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operating system gets a request from the browser to translate the address the user entered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A query created to check a local entry of the address exists in the system. In case it doesn't, the request is forwarded to the DNS resolver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Resolver is a server, usually configured by your ISP when you connect to the internet, that responsible for resolving your query by contacting other DNS servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Resolver contacts the root nameserver (aka as .)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The root nameserver responds with the address of the relevant Top Level Domain DNS server (if your address ends with org then the org TLD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Resolver then contacts the TLD DNS and TLD DNS responds with the IP address that matches the address the user typed in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Resolver passes this information to the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The user is happy :D
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of DNS records are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PTR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;AAAA
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a A record?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a AAAA record?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a PTR record?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While an A record points a domain name to an IP address, a PTR record does the opposite and resolves the IP address to a domain name.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a MX record?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Is DNS using TCP or UDP?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Round Robin DNS?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is DNS Record TTL? Why do we need it?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a zone? What types of zones are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Martin Kleppmann:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Many processes running on many machines...only message-passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the system may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and process pauses."
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Do you know what is "CAP theorem"? (aka as Brewer's theorem)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CAP theorem, it's not possible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is "Shared-Nothing" architecture?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's an architecture in which data is and retrieved from a single, non-shared, source usually exclusively connected to one node as opposed to architectures where the request can get to one of many nodes and the data will be retrieved from one shared location (storage, memory, ...).
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;What is HTTP?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Describe HTTP request lifecycle&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolve host by request to DNS resolver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client SYN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server SYN+ACK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client SYN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HTTP response
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;True or False? HTTP is stateful&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False. Server doesn't maintain state for incoming request.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How HTTP request looks like?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consits of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request line - request type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headers - content info like length, enconding, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Body (not always included)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What HTTP method types are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HEAD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PUT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CONNECT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRACE
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What HTTP response codes are there?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1xx - informational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2xx - Success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3xx - Redirect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4xx - Error, client fault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5xx - Error, server fault
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is HTTPS?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain HTTP Cookies&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is stateless. To share state, we can use Cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TODO: explain what is actually a Cookie

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How did you hear about us?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell them how did you hear about them :D
Relax, there is no wrong or right answer here...I think.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you describe a good leadership? What makes a good boss for you?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Tell me about a time where you didn't agree on an implementation&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How do you deal with a situation where key stakeholders are not around and a big decision needs to be made? &lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas (some of them bad and should not be used):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior DevOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your manager
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Give an example of a time you were able to change the view of a team about a particular tool/project/technology&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Have you ever caused a service outage? (or broke a working project, tool, ...?)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you worked in this area for more than 5 years it's hard to imagine the answer would be no. It also doesn't have to be big service outage. Maybe you merged some code that broke a project or its tests. Simply focus on what you learned from such experience.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Rank the following in order 1 to 5, where 1 is most important: salaray, benefits, career, team/people, work life balance&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You know best your order just have a good thought if you really want to put salary in top or bottom....
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You have three important tasks scheduled for today. One is for your boss, second for a colleague who is also a friend, third is for a customer. All tasks are equally important. What do you do first?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;You have a colleague you don‘t get along with. Tell us some strategies how you create a good work relationship with them anyway.&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad answer: I don't.
Better answer: Every person has strengths and weaknesses. This is true also for colleagues I don't have good work relationship with and this is what helps me to create good work relationship with them. If I am able to highlight or recognize their strengths I'm able to focus mainly on that when communicating with them.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What do you love about your work?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the best, but some ideas if you find it hard to express yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication with several different teams
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are your responsibilities in your current position?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You know the best :)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Why should we hire you for the role?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use and elaborate on one or all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autodidact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creativity (be able to support it with some actual examples)
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="user-content-questions-you-ask"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What do you like about working here?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How does the company promote personal growth?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt.
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at
setting expectations with projects.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What was your favorite project you've worked on?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of tests would you run for web application?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are unit tests?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain test harness?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is A/B testing?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What types of performances tests are you familiar with?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain the following types of tests:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endurance Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a connection pool?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connection Pool is a cache of database connections and the reason it's used is to avoid an overhead of establishing a connection for every query done to a database.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a connection leak?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A connection leak is a situation where database connection isn't closed after being created and is no longer needed.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is Table Lock?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Your database performs slowly than usual. More specifically, your queries are taking a lot of time. What would you do?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query for running queries and cancel the irrelevant queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for connection leaks (query for running connections and include their IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check for table locks and kill irrelevant locking sessions
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a connection leak?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a Data Warehouse?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant and non-volatile collection of data in support of organisation's decision-making process"
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is a data lake?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A single data source (at least usually) which is stored in a raw format.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is OLTP (Online transaction processing)?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain "3-Tier Architecture" (including pros and cons)&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the drawbacks of monolithic architecture?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not suitable for frequent code changes and the ability to deploy new features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not designed for today's infrastructure (like public clouds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scaling a team to work monolithic architecture is more challenging
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What are the advantages of micro-services architecture over a monolithic architecture?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Vertical Scaling&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vertical Scaling is the process of adding resources to increase power of existing servers. For example, adding more CPUs, adding more RAM, etc.
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Explain Horizontal Scaling&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Horizontal Scaling is the process of adding more resources that will be able handle requests as one unit
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you update each of the services in the following drawing without having app (foo.com) downtime?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;What is the problem with the following architecture and how would you fix it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/design/producers_consumers_issue.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/design/producers_consumers_issue.png" width="300x;" height="200px;" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The load on the producers or consumers may be high which will then cause them to hang or crash.&lt;br&gt;
Instead of working in "push mode", the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Users report that there is huge spike in process time when adding little bit more data to process as an input. What might be the problem?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/design/input-process-output.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/design/input-process-output.png" width="300x;" height="200px;" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;How would you scale the architecture from the previous question to hundreds of users?&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/249-now-thats-what-i-call-a-hacker/" rel="nofollow"&gt;true
story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, "legacy"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: You're gonna love this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: &lt;a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh"&gt;&lt;code&gt;smack-my-bitch-up.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - sends a text message "late at work" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: &lt;a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kumar-asshole.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - scans the inbox for emails from "Kumar" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like "help", "trouble", "sorry" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply "no worries mate, be careful next time".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: &lt;a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh"&gt;&lt;code&gt;hangover.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like "not feeling well/gonna work from home" etc. Adds a random "reason" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: (and the oscar goes to) &lt;a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fucking-coffee.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like &lt;code&gt;sys brew&lt;/code&gt;. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xxx: holy sh*t I'm keeping those&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we've found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is the result of &lt;a href="AUTHORS.md"&gt;many authors and translators&lt;/a&gt;.
Some of this
&lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands" rel="nofollow"&gt;originally&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix" rel="nofollow"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt;
on &lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know" rel="nofollow"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;,
but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements.
&lt;a href="https://airtable.com/shrzMhx00YiIVAWJg" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please submit a question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you have a question related to the command line. &lt;a href="/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please contribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you see an error or something that could be better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This guide is both for beginners and the experienced. The goals are &lt;em&gt;breadth&lt;/em&gt; (everything important), &lt;em&gt;specificity&lt;/em&gt; (give concrete examples of the most common case), and &lt;em&gt;brevity&lt;/em&gt; (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is written for Linux, with the exception of the "&lt;a href="#macos-only"&gt;macOS only&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="#windows-only"&gt;Windows only&lt;/a&gt;" sections. Many of the other items apply or can be installed on other Unices or macOS (or even Cygwin).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The focus is on interactive Bash, though many tips apply to other shells and to general Bash scripting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It includes both "standard" Unix commands as well as ones that require special package installs -- so long as they are important enough to merit inclusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep this to one page, content is implicitly included by reference. You're smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google. Use &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; (as appropriate) to install new programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://explainshell.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Explainshell&lt;/a&gt; to get a helpful breakdown of what commands, options, pipes etc. do.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn basic Bash. Actually, type &lt;code&gt;man bash&lt;/code&gt; and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn at least one text-based editor well. The &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; editor is one of the simplest for basic editing (opening, editing, saving, searching). However, for the power user in a text terminal, there is no substitute for Vim (&lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;), the hard-to-learn but venerable, fast, and full-featured editor. Many people also use the classic Emacs, particularly for larger editing tasks. (Of course, any modern software developer working on an extensive project is unlikely to use only a pure text-based editor and should also be familiar with modern graphical IDEs and tools.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know how to read official documentation with &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; (for the inquisitive, &lt;code&gt;man man&lt;/code&gt; lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is "regular" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with &lt;code&gt;apropos&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;help -d&lt;/code&gt;. You can find out whether a command is an executable, shell builtin or an alias by using &lt;code&gt;type command&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl cheat.sh/command&lt;/code&gt; will give a brief "cheat sheet" with common examples of how to use a shell command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about redirection of output and input using &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and pipes using &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. Know &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; overwrites the output file and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about file glob expansion with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; (and perhaps &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;) and quoting and the difference between double &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; and single &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be familiar with Bash job management: &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-z&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-c&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kill&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ssh-add&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic file management: &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; (in particular, learn what every column in &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; means), &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tail -f&lt;/code&gt; (or even better, &lt;code&gt;less +F&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code&gt;ln&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt; (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; (for a quick summary of disk usage: &lt;code&gt;du -hs *&lt;/code&gt;). For filesystem management, &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkfs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt;. Learn what an inode is (&lt;code&gt;ls -i&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;df -i&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic network management: &lt;code&gt;ip&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;traceroute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;route&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn and use a version control management system, such as &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;egrep&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-B&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;-C&lt;/code&gt; options are worth knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to use &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dnf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt; (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-everyday-use" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#everyday-use"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyday use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bash, use &lt;strong&gt;Tab&lt;/strong&gt; to complete arguments or list all available commands and &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-r&lt;/strong&gt; to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-r&lt;/strong&gt; repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press &lt;strong&gt;Enter&lt;/strong&gt; to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bash, use &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-w&lt;/strong&gt; to delete the last word, and &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-u&lt;/strong&gt; to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line. Use &lt;strong&gt;alt-b&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;alt-f&lt;/strong&gt; to move by word, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-a&lt;/strong&gt; to move cursor to beginning of line,  &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/strong&gt; to move cursor to end of line, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-k&lt;/strong&gt; to kill to the end of the line, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-l&lt;/strong&gt; to clear the screen. See &lt;code&gt;man readline&lt;/code&gt; for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example &lt;strong&gt;alt-.&lt;/strong&gt; cycles through previous arguments, and &lt;strong&gt;alt-&lt;/strong&gt;* expands a glob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use &lt;code&gt;set -o vi&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;set -o emacs&lt;/code&gt; to put it back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example &lt;code&gt;export EDITOR=vim&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-x&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-e&lt;/strong&gt; will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, &lt;strong&gt;escape-v&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see recent commands, use &lt;code&gt;history&lt;/code&gt;. Follow with &lt;code&gt;!n&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being &lt;code&gt;!$&lt;/code&gt; for last argument and &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; for last command (see "HISTORY EXPANSION" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-r&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;alt-.&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your home directory with &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;. Access files relative to your home directory with the &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; prefix (e.g. &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;). In &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; scripts refer to the home directory as &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go back to the previous working directory: &lt;code&gt;cd -&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit &lt;strong&gt;alt-#&lt;/strong&gt; to add a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-a&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;#&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;enter&lt;/strong&gt;). You can then return to it later via command history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;parallel&lt;/code&gt;). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (&lt;code&gt;-L&lt;/code&gt;) as well as parallelism (&lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt;). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use &lt;code&gt;xargs echo&lt;/code&gt; first. Also, &lt;code&gt;-I{}&lt;/code&gt; is handy. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      find &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; -name &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;*.py&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xargs grep some_function
      cat hosts &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pstree -p&lt;/code&gt; is a helpful display of the process tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;pgrep&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pkill&lt;/code&gt; to find or signal processes by name (&lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; is helpful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use &lt;code&gt;kill -STOP [pid]&lt;/code&gt;. For the full list, see &lt;code&gt;man 7 signal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;nohup&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;disown&lt;/code&gt; if you want a background process to keep running forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check what processes are listening via &lt;code&gt;netstat -lntp&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ss -plat&lt;/code&gt; (for TCP; add &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; for UDP) or &lt;code&gt;lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n&lt;/code&gt; (which also works on macOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fuser&lt;/code&gt; for open sockets and files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;uptime&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; to know how long the system has been running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;alias&lt;/code&gt; to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, &lt;code&gt;alias ll='ls -latr'&lt;/code&gt; creates a new alias &lt;code&gt;ll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save aliases, shell settings, and functions you commonly use in &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://superuser.com/a/183980/7106" rel="nofollow"&gt;arrange for login shells to source it&lt;/a&gt;. This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in &lt;code&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;. Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synchronize your configuration files (e.g. &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;) among various computers with Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that care is needed when variables and filenames include whitespace. Surround your Bash variables with quotes, e.g. &lt;code&gt;"$FOO"&lt;/code&gt;. Prefer the &lt;code&gt;-0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-print0&lt;/code&gt; options to enable null characters to delimit filenames, e.g. &lt;code&gt;locate -0 pattern | xargs -0 ls -al&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;find / -print0 -type d | xargs -0 ls -al&lt;/code&gt;. To iterate on filenames containing whitespace in a for loop, set your IFS to be a newline only using &lt;code&gt;IFS=$'\n'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bash scripts, use &lt;code&gt;set -x&lt;/code&gt; (or the variant &lt;code&gt;set -v&lt;/code&gt;, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use &lt;code&gt;set -e&lt;/code&gt; to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use &lt;code&gt;set -u&lt;/code&gt; to detect unset variable usages. Consider &lt;code&gt;set -o pipefail&lt;/code&gt; too, to abort on errors within pipes (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use &lt;code&gt;trap&lt;/code&gt; on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; -euo pipefail
      &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;trap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ERR&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; do something in current dir&lt;/span&gt;
      (cd /some/other/dir &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; other-command)
      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; continue in original dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: &lt;code&gt;${name:?error message}&lt;/code&gt;. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write &lt;code&gt;input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}&lt;/code&gt;. Using a default value if a variable is empty: &lt;code&gt;${name:-default}&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to have an additional (optional) parameter added to the previous example, you can use something like &lt;code&gt;output_file=${2:-logfile}&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;$2&lt;/code&gt; is omitted and thus empty, &lt;code&gt;output_file&lt;/code&gt; will be set to &lt;code&gt;logfile&lt;/code&gt;. Arithmetic expansion: &lt;code&gt;i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))&lt;/code&gt;. Sequences: &lt;code&gt;{1..10}&lt;/code&gt;. Trimming of strings: &lt;code&gt;${var%suffix}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;${var#prefix}&lt;/code&gt;. For example if &lt;code&gt;var=foo.pdf&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;echo ${var%.pdf}.txt&lt;/code&gt; prints &lt;code&gt;foo.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brace expansion using &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items.  This is helpful in examples like &lt;code&gt;mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir&lt;/code&gt; (which moves both files), &lt;code&gt;cp somefile{,.bak}&lt;/code&gt; (which expands to &lt;code&gt;cp somefile somefile.bak&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}&lt;/code&gt; (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree). Brace expansion is performed before any other expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and filename expansion. (For example, a range like &lt;code&gt;{1..20}&lt;/code&gt; cannot be expressed with variables using &lt;code&gt;{$a..$b}&lt;/code&gt;. Use &lt;code&gt;seq&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop instead, e.g., &lt;code&gt;seq $a $b&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;for((i=a; i&amp;lt;=b; i++)); do ... ; done&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of a command can be treated like a file via &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;(some command)&lt;/code&gt; (known as process substitution). For example, compare local &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; with a remote one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      diff /etc/hosts &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;&amp;lt;(&lt;/span&gt;ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing scripts you may want to put all of your code in curly braces. If the closing brace is missing, your script will be prevented from executing due to a syntax error. This makes sense when your script is going to be downloaded from the web, since it prevents partially downloaded scripts from executing:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{
      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Your code here&lt;/span&gt;
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A "here document" allows &lt;a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;redirection of multiple lines of input&lt;/a&gt; as if from a file:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF
input
on multiple lines
EOF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: &lt;code&gt;some-command &amp;gt;logfile 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;some-command &amp;amp;&amp;gt;logfile&lt;/code&gt;. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;man ascii&lt;/code&gt; for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, &lt;code&gt;man unicode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;man utf-8&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;man latin1&lt;/code&gt; are helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tmux.github.io/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. &lt;code&gt;byobu&lt;/code&gt; can enhance screen or tmux by providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is &lt;a href="https://github.com/bogner/dtach"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dtach&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with &lt;code&gt;-L&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; (and occasionally &lt;code&gt;-R&lt;/code&gt;) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this &lt;code&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      TCPKeepAlive=yes
      ServerAliveInterval=15
      ServerAliveCountMax=6
      Compression=yes
      ControlMaster auto
      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
      ControlPersist yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: &lt;code&gt;StrictHostKeyChecking=no&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ForwardAgent=yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="https://mosh.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mosh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; and easy to bungle, use something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      stat -c &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;%A %a %n&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /etc/timezone&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use &lt;a href="https://github.com/mooz/percol"&gt;&lt;code&gt;percol&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;), use &lt;code&gt;fpp&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker"&gt;PathPicker&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use:
&lt;code&gt;python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777&lt;/code&gt; (for port 7777 and Python 2) and &lt;code&gt;python -m http.server 7777&lt;/code&gt; (for port 7777 and Python 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For running a command as another user, use &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. Defaults to running as root; use &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; to specify another user. Use &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; to login as that user (you will be asked for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; password).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For switching the shell to another user, use &lt;code&gt;su username&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;su - username&lt;/code&gt;. The latter with "-" gets an environment as if another user just logged in. Omitting the username defaults to root. You will be asked for the password &lt;em&gt;of the user you are switching to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about the &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/CommonErrorMessages/ArgumentListTooLong" rel="nofollow"&gt;128K limit&lt;/a&gt; on command lines. This "Argument list too long" error is common when wildcard matching large numbers of files. (When this happens alternatives like &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; may help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a basic calculator (and of course access to Python in general), use the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; interpreter. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 2+3

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-processing-files-and-data" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#processing-files-and-data"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Processing files and data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To locate a file by name in the current directory, &lt;code&gt;find . -iname '*something*'&lt;/code&gt; (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use &lt;code&gt;locate something&lt;/code&gt; (but bear in mind &lt;code&gt;updatedb&lt;/code&gt; may not have indexed recently created files).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For general searching through source or data files, there are several options more advanced or faster than &lt;code&gt;grep -r&lt;/code&gt;, including (in rough order from older to newer) &lt;a href="https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("the silver searcher"), and &lt;a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"&gt;&lt;code&gt;rg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ripgrep).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert HTML to text: &lt;code&gt;lynx -dump -stdin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try &lt;a href="http://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For example, to convert a Markdown document to Word format: &lt;code&gt;pandoc README.md --from markdown --to docx -o temp.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you must handle XML, &lt;code&gt;xmlstarlet&lt;/code&gt; is old but good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JSON, use &lt;a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For interactive use, also see &lt;a href="https://github.com/simeji/jid"&gt;&lt;code&gt;jid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/jiq"&gt;&lt;code&gt;jiq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For YAML, use &lt;a href="https://github.com/0k/shyaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;shyaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Excel or CSV files, &lt;a href="https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit"&gt;csvkit&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;code&gt;in2csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;csvcut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;csvjoin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;csvgrep&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Amazon S3, &lt;a href="https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd"&gt;&lt;code&gt;s3cmd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is convenient and &lt;a href="https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd"&gt;&lt;code&gt;s4cmd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is faster. Amazon's &lt;a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli"&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the improved &lt;a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/saws"&gt;&lt;code&gt;saws&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are essential for other AWS-related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt;, including uniq's &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; options -- see one-liners below. See also &lt;code&gt;comm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;paste&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; to manipulate text files. Many people use &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt; but forget about &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt; to count newlines (&lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt;), characters (&lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt;), words (&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;) and bytes (&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;tee&lt;/code&gt; to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout, as in &lt;code&gt;ls -al | tee file.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more complex calculations, including grouping, reversing fields, and statistical calculations, consider &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;datamash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways, including sorting order (collation) and performance. Most Linux installations will set &lt;code&gt;LANG&lt;/code&gt; or other locale variables to a local setting like US English. But be aware sorting will change if you change locale. And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run &lt;em&gt;many times&lt;/em&gt; slower. In some situations (such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below) you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order, using &lt;code&gt;export LC_ALL=C&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set a specific command's environment by prefixing its invocation with the environment variable settings, as in &lt;code&gt;TZ=Pacific/Fiji date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know basic &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; for simple data munging. See &lt;a href="#one-liners"&gt;One-liners&lt;/a&gt; for examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To replace all occurrences of a string in place, in one or more files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      perl -pi.bak -e &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;s/old-string/new-string/g&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; my-files-&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files, try &lt;a href="https://github.com/jlevy/repren"&gt;&lt;code&gt;repren&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (In some cases the &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; command also allows multiple renames, but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Full rename of filenames, directories, and contents foo -&amp;gt; bar:&lt;/span&gt;
      repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Recover backup files whatever.bak -&amp;gt; whatever:&lt;/span&gt;
      repren --renames --from &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;(.*)\.bak&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; --to &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;\1&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.bak
      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Same as above, using rename, if available:&lt;/span&gt;
      rename &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;s/\.bak$//&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;.bak&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the man page says, &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It's known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally. When security restrictions allow, using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; allows recovery of a transfer without restarting from scratch. It also is among the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnote.net/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-files.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;fastest ways&lt;/a&gt; to delete large numbers of files:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkdir empty &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; rmdir some-dir&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For monitoring progress when processing files, use &lt;a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/pycp"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pycp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/pmonitor"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pmonitor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Xfennec/progress"&gt;&lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rsync --progress&lt;/code&gt;, or, for block-level copying, &lt;code&gt;dd status=progress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;shuf&lt;/code&gt; to shuffle or select random lines from a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;'s options. For numbers, use &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;-h&lt;/code&gt; for handling human-readable numbers (e.g. from &lt;code&gt;du -h&lt;/code&gt;). Know how keys work (&lt;code&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-k&lt;/code&gt;). In particular, watch out that you need to write &lt;code&gt;-k1,1&lt;/code&gt; to sort by only the first field; &lt;code&gt;-k1&lt;/code&gt; means sort according to the whole line. Stable sort (&lt;code&gt;sort -s&lt;/code&gt;) can be useful. For example, to sort first by field 2, then secondarily by field 1, you can use &lt;code&gt;sort -k1,1 | sort -s -k2,2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash (e.g. for the -t argument to sort), press &lt;strong&gt;ctrl-v&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[Tab]&lt;/strong&gt; or write &lt;code&gt;$'\t'&lt;/code&gt; (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard tools for patching source code are &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;patch&lt;/code&gt;. See also &lt;code&gt;diffstat&lt;/code&gt; for summary statistics of a diff and &lt;code&gt;sdiff&lt;/code&gt; for a side-by-side diff. Note &lt;code&gt;diff -r&lt;/code&gt; works for entire directories. Use &lt;code&gt;diff -r tree1 tree2 | diffstat&lt;/code&gt; for a summary of changes. Use &lt;code&gt;vimdiff&lt;/code&gt; to compare and edit files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For binary files, use &lt;code&gt;hd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hexdump&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;xxd&lt;/code&gt; for simple hex dumps and &lt;code&gt;bvi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hexedit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;biew&lt;/code&gt; for binary editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for binary files, &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; (plus &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) lets you find bits of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For binary diffs (delta compression), use &lt;code&gt;xdelta3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert text encodings, try &lt;code&gt;iconv&lt;/code&gt;. Or &lt;code&gt;uconv&lt;/code&gt; for more advanced use; it supports some advanced Unicode things. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Displays hex codes or actual names of characters (useful for debugging):&lt;/span&gt;
      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;::Any-Hex;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; input.txt
      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;::Any-Name;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; input.txt
      &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Lowercase and removes all accents (by expanding and dropping them):&lt;/span&gt;
      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;::Any-Lower; ::Any-NFD; [:Nonspacing Mark:] &amp;gt;; ::Any-NFC;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; input.txt &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; output.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To split files into pieces, see &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; (to split by size) and &lt;code&gt;csplit&lt;/code&gt; (to split by a pattern).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date and time: To get the current date and time in the helpful &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow"&gt;ISO 8601&lt;/a&gt; format, use &lt;code&gt;date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"&lt;/code&gt; (other options &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7216358/date-command-on-os-x-doesnt-have-iso-8601-i-option" rel="nofollow"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164826/date-command-iso-8601-option" rel="nofollow"&gt;problematic&lt;/a&gt;). To manipulate date and time expressions, use &lt;code&gt;dateadd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;datediff&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;strptime&lt;/code&gt; etc. from &lt;a href="http://www.fresse.org/dateutils/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dateutils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;zless&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zmore&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zcat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;zgrep&lt;/code&gt; to operate on compressed files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File attributes are settable via &lt;code&gt;chattr&lt;/code&gt; and offer a lower-level alternative to file permissions. For example, to protect against accidental file deletion the immutable flag:  &lt;code&gt;sudo chattr +i /critical/directory/or/file&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;getfacl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setfacl&lt;/code&gt; to save and restore file permissions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   getfacl -R /some/path &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; permissions.txt
   setfacl --restore=permissions.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create empty files quickly, use &lt;code&gt;truncate&lt;/code&gt; (creates &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file" rel="nofollow"&gt;sparse file&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;fallocate&lt;/code&gt; (ext4, xfs, btrfs and ocfs2 filesystems), &lt;code&gt;xfs_mkfile&lt;/code&gt; (almost any filesystems, comes in xfsprogs package), &lt;code&gt;mkfile&lt;/code&gt; (for Unix-like systems like Solaris, Mac OS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-system-debugging" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#system-debugging"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;System debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For web debugging, &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;curl -I&lt;/code&gt; are handy, or their &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; equivalents, or the more modern &lt;a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie"&gt;&lt;code&gt;httpie&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know current cpu/disk status, the classic tools are &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; (or the better &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;iotop&lt;/code&gt;. Use &lt;code&gt;iostat -mxz 15&lt;/code&gt; for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For network connection details, use &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a quick overview of what's happening on a system, &lt;code&gt;dstat&lt;/code&gt; is especially useful. For broadest overview with details, use &lt;a href="https://github.com/nicolargo/glances"&gt;&lt;code&gt;glances&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know memory status, run and understand the output of &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vmstat&lt;/code&gt;. In particular, be aware the "cached" value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache, so effectively counts toward the "free" value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish, but a simple trick on Oracle's and some other JVMs is that you can run &lt;code&gt;kill -3 &amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a full stack trace and heap summary (including generational garbage collection details, which can be highly informative) will be dumped to stderr/logs. The JDK's &lt;code&gt;jps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jstat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jstack&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jmap&lt;/code&gt; are useful. &lt;a href="https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools"&gt;SJK tools&lt;/a&gt; are more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mtr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a better traceroute, to identify network issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For looking at why a disk is full, &lt;a href="https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ncdu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saves time over the usual commands like &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find which socket or process is using bandwidth, try &lt;a href="http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;iftop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/raboof/nethogs"&gt;&lt;code&gt;nethogs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ab&lt;/code&gt; tool (comes with Apache) is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance. For more complex load testing, try &lt;code&gt;siege&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more serious network debugging, &lt;a href="https://wireshark.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wireshark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolstshark.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;tshark&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ngrep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ltrace&lt;/code&gt;. These can be helpful if a program is failing, hanging, or crashing, and you don't know why, or if you want to get a general idea of performance. Note the profiling option (&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;), and the ability to attach to a running process (&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt;). Use trace child option (&lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt;) to avoid missing important calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know about &lt;code&gt;ldd&lt;/code&gt; to check shared libraries etc — but &lt;a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/ldd-arbitrary-code-execution/" rel="nofollow"&gt;never run it on untrusted files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know how to connect to a running process with &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; and get its stack traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;. It's amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems. Examples: &lt;code&gt;/proc/cpuinfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/meminfo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/cmdline&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/xxx/cwd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/xxx/exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/xxx/fd/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc/xxx/smaps&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; is the process id or pid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When debugging why something went wrong in the past, &lt;a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be very helpful. It shows historic statistics on CPU, memory, network, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deeper systems and performance analyses, look at &lt;code&gt;stap&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki" rel="nofollow"&gt;SystemTap&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_%28Linux%29" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/draios/sysdig"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sysdig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check what OS you're on with &lt;code&gt;uname&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uname -a&lt;/code&gt; (general Unix/kernel info) or &lt;code&gt;lsb_release -a&lt;/code&gt; (Linux distro info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; whenever something's acting really funny (it could be hardware or driver issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you delete a file and it doesn't free up expected disk space as reported by &lt;code&gt;du&lt;/code&gt;, check whether the file is in use by a process:
&lt;code&gt;lsof | grep deleted | grep "filename-of-my-big-file"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-one-liners" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#one-liners"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One-liners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few examples of piecing together commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection, union, and difference of text files via &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt;. Suppose &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the &lt;code&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; option if &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; is on a small root partition.) See also the note about &lt;code&gt;LC_ALL&lt;/code&gt; above and &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; option (left out for clarity below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      sort a b &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; uniq &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; c   &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; c is a union b&lt;/span&gt;
      sort a b &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; uniq -d &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; c   &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; c is a intersect b&lt;/span&gt;
      sort a b b &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; uniq -u &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; c   &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; c is set difference a - b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty-print two JSON files, normalizing their syntax, then coloring and paginating the result:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      diff &amp;lt;(jq --sort-keys . &amp;lt; file1.json) &amp;lt;(jq --sort-keys . &amp;lt; file2.json) | colordiff | less -R
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;grep . *&lt;/code&gt; to quickly examine the contents of all files in a directory (so each line is paired with the filename), or &lt;code&gt;head -100 *&lt;/code&gt; (so each file has a heading). This can be useful for directories filled with config settings like those in &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing all numbers in the third column of a text file (this is probably 3X faster and 3X less code than equivalent Python):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      awk &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;{ x += $3 } END { print x }&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; myfile&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see sizes/dates on a tree of files, this is like a recursive &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; but is easier to read than &lt;code&gt;ls -lR&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      find &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; -type f -ls&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say you have a text file, like a web server log, and a certain value that appears on some lines, such as an &lt;code&gt;acct_id&lt;/code&gt; parameter that is present in the URL. If you want a tally of how many requests for each &lt;code&gt;acct_id&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      egrep -o &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;acct_id=[0-9]+&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; access.log &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; cut -d= -f2 &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sort &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; uniq -c &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sort -rn&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continuously monitor changes, use &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. check changes to files in a directory with &lt;code&gt;watch -d -n 2 'ls -rtlh | tail'&lt;/code&gt; or to network settings while troubleshooting your wifi settings with &lt;code&gt;watch -d -n 2 ifconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this function to get a random tip from this document (parses Markdown and extracts an item):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;      &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-en"&gt;taocl()&lt;/span&gt; {

          xmlstarlet fo --html --dropdtd &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
          xmlstarlet sel -t -v &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;(html/body/ul/li[count(p)&amp;gt;0])[&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;$RANDOM&lt;/span&gt; mod last()+1]&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
          xmlstarlet unesc &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; fmt -80 &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; iconv -t US
      }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are items relevant &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Package management with &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; (Homebrew) and/or &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt; (MacPorts). These can be used to install on macOS many of the above commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy output of any command to a desktop app with &lt;code&gt;pbcopy&lt;/code&gt; and paste input from one with &lt;code&gt;pbpaste&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable the Option key in macOS Terminal as an alt key (such as used in the commands above like &lt;strong&gt;alt-b&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;alt-f&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.), open Preferences -&amp;gt; Profiles -&amp;gt; Keyboard and select "Use Option as Meta key".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open a file with a desktop app, use &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;open -a /Applications/Whatever.app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight: Search files with &lt;code&gt;mdfind&lt;/code&gt; and list metadata (such as photo EXIF info) with &lt;code&gt;mdls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware macOS is based on BSD Unix, and many commands (for example &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;) have many subtle variations from Linux, which is largely influenced by System V-style Unix and GNU tools. You can often tell the difference by noting a man page has the heading "BSD General Commands Manual." In some cases GNU versions can be installed, too (such as &lt;code&gt;gawk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gsed&lt;/code&gt; for GNU awk and sed). If writing cross-platform Bash scripts, avoid such commands (for example, consider Python or &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;) or test carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get macOS release information, use &lt;code&gt;sw_vers&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the power of the Unix shell under Microsoft Windows by installing &lt;a href="https://cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the things described in this document will work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows 10, you can use &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about" rel="nofollow"&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a familiar Bash environment with Unix command line utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you mainly want to use GNU developer tools (such as GCC) on Windows, consider &lt;a href="http://www.mingw.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MinGW&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSYS&lt;/a&gt; package, which provides utilities such as bash, gawk, make and grep. MSYS doesn't have all the features compared to Cygwin. MinGW is particularly useful for creating native Windows ports of Unix tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option to get Unix look and feel under Windows is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dthree/cash"&gt;Cash&lt;/a&gt;. Note that only very few Unix commands and command-line options are available in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can perform and script most Windows system administration tasks from the command line by learning and using &lt;code&gt;wmic&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native command-line Windows networking tools you may find useful include &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ipconfig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tracert&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;netstat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can perform &lt;a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rundll32-shortcut-commands-windows" rel="nofollow"&gt;many useful Windows tasks&lt;/a&gt; by invoking the &lt;code&gt;Rundll32&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install additional Unix programs with the Cygwin's package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;mintty&lt;/code&gt; as your command-line window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the Windows clipboard through &lt;code&gt;/dev/clipboard&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;cygstart&lt;/code&gt; to open an arbitrary file through its registered application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the Windows registry with &lt;code&gt;regtool&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that a &lt;code&gt;C:\&lt;/code&gt; Windows drive path becomes &lt;code&gt;/cygdrive/c&lt;/code&gt; under Cygwin, and that Cygwin's &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; appears under &lt;code&gt;C:\cygwin&lt;/code&gt; on Windows. Convert between Cygwin and Windows-style file paths with &lt;code&gt;cygpath&lt;/code&gt;. This is most useful in scripts that invoke Windows programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of very small tasks, code is written so others can read it. With power comes responsibility. The fact you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do something in Bash doesn't necessarily mean you should! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当你试图对工作方式进行这些改进时，政治斗争可能抬起它丑陋的头——《拥抱变革：从优秀走向卓越的 48 个组织转型模式》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 年前，也就是 2016 年，我一直在思索着如何更好的构建软件？如何更好的重写软件系统？思索出了 RePractise 七步曲，顺带着写了那本《全栈应用开发：精益实践》。书中，对于遗留系统的建议，便是&lt;strong&gt;重写&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而在我的最近一本书《&lt;a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/33477112/" rel="nofollow"&gt;前端架构：从入门到微前端&lt;/a&gt;》中，我提及到了五种前端架构的改进方式：更新、迁移、重构、重写、重搭。重写，依旧是我推荐的主要方式，技术栈老旧、旧有代码不规范。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可是呢，随着岁月的流失，我发现重写并不能大部分的解决问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我总以为，编写软件的的人会随着年龄的增长，写出更好的软件系统。然而，软件开发者在经历到了 3 ~ 5 年的职业编码之后，有些成为了技术管理者，写不下去的转行、在线炒粉去了，还有的 &lt;code&gt;return true&lt;/code&gt; 成为了销售……，剩下的，还有那个不断接锅的 Tech Lead（还在继续写代码）。就好像韭菜一样，总可以吃掉新鲜的，总会由新的人来开发新的系统。所以，《重构：改善既有代码的设计》总是能割到一波又一波的韭菜 —— 那个会重构的人，代码写得少了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时过境迁，我对软件开发又有一些新的领悟：重构比重写更有挑战性。或许是重写和新写没有区别，或者是经历了一个个系统的重构过程，我大抵是明白了：&lt;strong&gt;哪来的和旧系统划清界线&lt;/strong&gt;。系统腐烂时，没有人能说清整个系统，甚至于一半的功能都相当的困难。与此同时，或许系统的用户对系统的功能比你更加了解。因为，你会从他们那收到 bug 的反馈：以前不是有这个功能吗，非常好用 —— 用户可能会骗你，他/她经常用那个功能，但是那个功能是存在的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从旧系统中汲取知识，一个逃离不了的话题，一个永远的痛。系统重构并不是一个简单的活，我们要不断地平衡：业务开发与重构过程，并尽量保证业务优先。它还涉及到一系列的软件开发实践：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;创建重构防护网，保证重构过程的安全性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;可随时继续的重构演进策略&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;评估&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API 设计合理性评估&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;模块分层架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;架构合理度评估与对应的改进方案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;公共代码的拆分策略&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;面向过程代码转面向对象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;代码坏味道识别与代码重构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;合适的设计模式替换旧的散弹式修改&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也因此，在先前提到的 5 种方式中，重构可以说是最难的一种。设计新的架构很容易，但是要重构到设计模式，重构到领域驱动设计，重构到到整洁的架构，并不是一件容易的事情。你需要持续不断地练习，但是这样的机会并不多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可重构到最后，我们还会再回过头来看这些问题。我们的重点应该是：解决提出问题的人。正是那些能力不够的开发人员，导致了我们的系统需要一次大规模的重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那么，正确的做法，应该是在日常的开发中不断重构，并引入技术债看板，不断优化和解决这些技术债。故而，技术债管理优于重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-为什么重构" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#为什么重构"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;为什么重构？&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重构（名词）：对软件内部结构的一种调整，目的是在不改变软件可观察行为的前提下，提高其可理解性，降低其修改成本。 重构（动词）：使用一系列重构手法，在不改变软件可观察行为的前提下，调整其结构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从定义上来说，重构意味着，我们不能改变现有软件的行为，你的 bug 还应该是 bug。只是呢，我们可以顺带着修复这个 bug，但是它绝不能冠上重构的名义。如此一来，怕是会被人误解。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;既然，不添加新的功能，也不减少现有的功能，那对于业务系统来说有什么价值呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重构的唯一目的就是让我们开发更快，用更少的工作量创造更大的价值。—— 《重构：改善既有代码的设计》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，总的来说，重构是为了 &lt;code&gt;￥￥￥&lt;/code&gt;。如果不能创造更多的价值，那么你在扯什么犊子的重构。但是，这种价值往往都不是直接体现。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;改善既有代码的设计。副标题是最好的说明。&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重构的投入与回报并非呈线性关系。—— 《领域驱动设计：软件核心复杂性应对之道》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人们总以为重构能带来：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;更少的代码&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;更稳定的系统&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它们都是&lt;strong&gt;可能&lt;/strong&gt;带来的效果，而不是一定会。如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;当我们拆分一个上帝类的时候，我们可能拆出了三个类、四个类，因为那些 import、package、type 的 declaration，反而带来了更多的代码。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;而当我们发现重复代码，并且它们是可被抽象的，那么我们就可以消去一半的代码。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果我们在重构的过程中，发现 bug，那么必然系统会更加稳定。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;而如果因为我们重构，导致别人合并代码时发生冲突，反而可能会带来 bug。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们是基于一系列的假设，才有了对应的结果描述。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而尽管我们达不成上述的好处，但我们仍然可以追求：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;编程的技艺&lt;/strong&gt;。稳定的业务代码，便容易选择合理的识别设计模式。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;重构的手法&lt;/strong&gt;。是的，如果你持续练习的话。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;持续重构的意识&lt;/strong&gt; 。我们真正意思到烂代码带来的问题。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;模式和原则&lt;/strong&gt;。遇到相似的情况时，可以用相似的重构手法。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;抽象能力&lt;/strong&gt;。后期总结，往往比前期更易于实践。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;总的来说，它带来了更好的效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;日常的开发中，如果你说出你要重构的时候，有人对此挑战的话，那么说明需要培养相应的文化 —— 程序员的匠艺。好的代码不是一把写出来的，而是持续的演进和重构出来的&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果有开发人员，经常提出需要重构的时候，你要看看是否真的合理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;持续在在日常开发中进行小重构，应该是开发人员的一种&lt;strong&gt;自我修养&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于大规模重构来说 ，一个最为常见的例子是：在接手别人或者别的系统的代码。觉得原有的代码不符合现有团队的风格，不满足再有的开发习惯。但是，根据我的观察，开发人员往往只是在改造系统，而非真正意义上的重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;把握重构的时机是很难的一件事情，特别是如果你要进行大的系统改动，如果没有出现真正的痛点。那么，即使我们觉得诸多设计不合理的地方，我们往往可能并不被允许重构，也没有时间进行重构。可一旦连业务人员，也觉得系统需要重构的时候，那么系统也许需要重写了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;即便于对未来有价值，我们也仍需要等待更合适的时机，如：代码库拆分、整洁架构中的领域层拆分等等。我们都知道它们带来的好处，但是我们尚没有那么迫切。反而，因为拆分，我们可能会带来额外的重构成本和维护成本。如我之前在重构 &lt;a href="https://github.com/phodal/coca"&gt;Coca&lt;/a&gt; 的时候，我在拆分 domain 层的时候，显得没有价值。我花了一两天的时间，把依赖于操作系统的部分，从代码中剥离了出去。我只是在试验 domain 层的好处，但是我并没有办法直接证明它的好处。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;直到，我开始为 Coca 添加 WASM 支持的时候，编译成功了。并且，拆分之后，构建出来的 wasm 包的大小减少到原来的一半，因为有大量的依赖是我所不需要的。如果按正常的重构逻辑，应该是在我们在未来计划添加 WASM 的时候，架构师才允许我们拆分出来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们不应该做大规模预先的设计，也不应该过度的设计；我们也没有理由做大规模的预先重构设计，准备好方案，在时间恰当的时候，实施方案。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-说清重构的价值" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#说清重构的价值"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;说清重构的价值&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重构，无法在短期内创造价值，哪怕是创造了大量的价值，它也难以&lt;strong&gt;直接&lt;/strong&gt;体现出来。它可以提升代码的可读性，可维护性……，但是总的来说，它是在以特定的方式降低系统的维护成本。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再说说可维护性，比如，你使用了更好的设计模式代替了复制、粘贴，它可能还不如原来的代码生成器好用。开发的过程快了，维护就是一坨屎。所以，我说没有维护过旧系统的人，不懂得重构的好处。白天不懂得夜的美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;既然如此，让我们就再考虑一下重构的价值。我想了很久这个问题，直到我从《遗留系统重构指南》看到一些示例：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;阶段&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;描述&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;业务价值&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;初步重构。定义组件接口，将组件拆分为独立的 jar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;清晰的接口能增加代码的可维护性&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;重写身份认证。更改密码的存储方式&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;更好地遵守数据安全法规&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;重写搜索组件。切换到不同的搜索引擎实现&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;搜索结果质量更好。用户更容易找到产品&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;重构推荐组件。&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;可以快速地切换不同的算法&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，仍旧存在大量的难以描述的价值——至少我是不知道从何说起。这里的代码、架构有坏味道，得去重构，便是我，一个工程师的思维。只是呢，真正有意义的业务价值，都是 TBC……。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尽管我们说，重构尽量不要影响业务开发，但是如果正在开发的功能部分，有较大的问题。那么，我们不得不调整策略，优先支持这部分的功能，而不是等完成后，再花费时间来对它们进行重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-系统重构模式与原则" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#系统重构模式与原则"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;系统重构模式与原则&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;设计模式强调为开发大规模系统提供可复用的设计指南。 ——  《反模式：危机中软件、架构和项目的重构》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;就重构的基本原则来说，倒也不是很复杂：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;小步前进。走一小步，提交一次代码，方便回滚，有一天你会懂的。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;随时可用。如果不能保证随时可用，那就说不上是重构了。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;融入日常。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当你习惯了重构，记得在日常工作中使用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-重构模式epdca" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#重构模式epdca"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;重构模式：EPDCA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我尝试从书中找到一个合适的模式，但是都没有发现符合我的步骤。便在 PDCA 的前面加了个 E，代表了 evaluate：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;识别需要重构的地方&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;制定重构计划，&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;执行计划的重构任务&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;使用测试对重构是否影响业务功能进行检察&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;调整下一次重构策略&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对系统进行大规模重构的过程中，最难的地方在于识别，因为代码坏味道多的地方不一定是价值最高的。寻找你的价值曲线，寻找价值高、实施难度低的部分，是最体现你价值的地方。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-四级重构" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#四级重构"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;四级重构&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;实践的过程中，我们以拆解的方式，一步步由系统架构到代码级拆分。在某次吃饭的过程中，我发现不太对劲。我明明用的是敏捷式的重构方式，而非瀑布模式。它对应于四个不同的重构级别：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;架构重构&lt;/strong&gt;。在不改变业务逻辑的情况下，根据单一职责和依赖倒置原则的思想：对系统进行模块拆分与合并，以明确职责降低耦合度；对包进行重新规划，划分包之间的边界，减少代码间的耦合。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;模型重构&lt;/strong&gt;。在包含测试的情况下，通过识别和发现模型的行为，将行为聚合到模型中：根据方法名称、参数、返回判定内聚到模型中；从流程梳理是否符合业务场景 。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;模式重构&lt;/strong&gt;。对于特定代码坏味道产生的问题，通过结合架构模式、设计模式来提升可读性。如：使用工厂模式统一管理对象的创建；使用策略模式降低复杂度。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;代码重构&lt;/strong&gt;。对于一些小的代码坏味道，可以通过 IDE 重构来快速改善即有代码，而不会影响到业务功能。如：复杂条件语句的提取；使用参数对象重构参数过多。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对应的模式如下图所示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f8d134031f5308dc01ca6026d7d08b3d77b94a7b/68747470733a2f2f6d6967726174696f6e2e696e6b2f696d616765732f7265666163746f72696e672d6c6576656c732e706e67"&gt;&lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f8d134031f5308dc01ca6026d7d08b3d77b94a7b/68747470733a2f2f6d6967726174696f6e2e696e6b2f696d616765732f7265666163746f72696e672d6c6576656c732e706e67" alt="四级重构" data-canonical-src="https://migration.ink/images/refactoring-levels.png" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一点倒是与我们设计系统的时候，采用的《&lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com/blog/architecture-pyramid/" rel="nofollow"&gt;架构金字塔&lt;/a&gt;》颇为一致的：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;小步前进，拉一下最新的代码。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多说无益，步子迈大的时候，你就会回到这句话上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;或许因为我合作的同事主要是 ThoughtWorks 的员工，所以在项目合作上，代码水平并不会太差；或许因为我能容忍那些年轻的开发人员犯的错。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我是一个喜欢用 master 分支的开发人员，主要是作为一个 Tech Lead，我并不想成为一个专职的 code reviewew。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，在 master 分支上重构，对于每个人都是一个极大的考验。有没有足够的测试覆盖？有没有足够的工程支持？有没有配合的团队合作？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于采用 pull request / merge request 机制的团队来说，重构并不会一帆风顺。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于大的重构来说，如目录调整，你还能在花点时间重做。如果是代码重构，一旦重来的话，你可能会忘记你到底修改了什么。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也经常不得不找个夜深人静的时间，加会班，提交上代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，当你采用 PR 机制的时候，记得做一下笔记，写写你打算怎么改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;并非很有的人都具备足够的能力参与到重构的过程中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，在我们进入重构之前，需要：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;确保对方有足够的能力&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;确保和对方对于重构有共同的看法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;确保对方能配合你工作&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此，需要一些培训，又或者是激烈的讨论。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他/她们需要具备以下的基本技能：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;理解面向对象设计&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;了解设计模式&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;了解写测试的重要性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;了解为什么要重构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;追求代码质量&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然了，在了解的基本上有更深入的理解也是不错的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于一个大的系统来说，系统的每一部分并非都是等价的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;系统的核心就是系统的 core domain（核心域），一个有能力的管理者，能识别到哪一部分是系统的核心组成，并为它分配最好的开发人员；与此同时，对于支撑的部分来说，管理者只会分配少数的核心开发人员，只用于确保功能能按期完成。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;按照 DDD 的思想来看，就是核心域、支撑域、通用域的区别。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于技术债务，它的利息表现为系统的不稳定性，以及由于临时性手段和缺乏合适的设计、文档工作和测试带来的不断攀升的维护成本。 —— 《架构师应该知道的 97 件事》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如 Robert Nord 提出的 “技术债务全景图”（Tech Debt Landscape） 所示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;技术债对于软件的影响：可维护性（Maintainability）、可演进性（Evolvability），而这些技术债对于非技术人员来说都是不可见的。它们源于生活，藏于黑暗中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在重构开始之前，我们可以进行技术债的头脑风暴，收集每个开发人员每迫切解决的技术痛点。并按照优先级来评估这些技术债，列入我们的重构范围中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如我的同事在《&lt;a href="https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/managing-technical-debt/" rel="nofollow"&gt;技术债治理的四条原则&lt;/a&gt;》 一文中所介绍的，我们可以在对应的限界上下文里，可视化技术债：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/tech-debt-mapping.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/tech-debt-mapping.png" alt="Classified Technical Debt Mapping" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;再根据 “核心领域优于其他子域” 的原则，及其严重程度，来划分出技术债的优先级。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如我在那篇 《&lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com/blog/refactor-mvc-architecture-to-ddd/" rel="nofollow"&gt;分层架构重构&lt;/a&gt;》 中所说，在大量的现有系统中，我们发现了 MVC 架构模式被落地为三层分层架构（controller-service-model）。开发人员对它们的错误等同，导致了架构上的一系列错误。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于简单的系统来说，CSM 的包结构问题不大。或者说，对于非常简单的系统来说，大泥球架构也没有问题。我们所针对的是那些中大规模的系统。在这些系统里，系统并非一次性的，开发出来就不再维护了。因此，它们需要对更合适的架构设计和包的拆分分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;借助于 &lt;a href="https://github.com/newlee/tequila"&gt;Tequila&lt;/a&gt; 这样的架构可视化工具，又或者是 &lt;code&gt;coca arch&lt;/code&gt;，便可以得到项目的调用关系图，它可以在某种层面上反应出系统的架构。根据它，我们可以知道：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;项目的结构划分是否合理&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;查看项目的代码中是否存在循环依赖的情况&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;结果如下图所示：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;通过调用关系图，我们也可以查看类之间、包之间是否存在相互依赖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于这部分内容来说，你可以直接采用成熟的商业工具，如 SonarQube 便可以完成这方面的工作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你也可以通过 &lt;code&gt;coca bs&lt;/code&gt; 来做一些简单的 Bad Smell 收集：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-json"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{
   &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;dataClass&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: [
      {
         &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;File&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;examples/api/BookController.java&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
         &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;BS&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;dataClass&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      }
   ],
   &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;lazyElement&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: [
      {
         &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;File&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;examples/api/model/BookRepresentaion.java&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
         &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;BS&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;lazyElement&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      }
   ]
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而后，再生成对应的重构建议。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-收集-todo" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#收集-todo"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;收集 Todo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;代码中的 Todo 注释，是一些本应该发生的事情，本应该做好，但是我没有立即去做。换句话来说，Todo 都是项目中的技术债务，就了可能就永远不会做。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，我们需要有工具来查找项目的 Todo，如笔者编写的 Coca，可以寻找代码中的 Todo，包含其对应的日期、作者、提交信息、文件名及对其的行数等信息：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;MESSAGES&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;FILENAME&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;LINE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;happens on macosx, don't know why&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../ContributedLibraryTableCellJPanel.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;118&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make this a method of Theme&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../ContributedLibraryTableCellJPanel.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;233&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Do a better job in refreshing  only the needed element&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../LibraryManagerUI.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;241&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Do a better job in refreshing  only the needed element&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../LibraryManagerUI.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;273&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make this a method of Theme&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../MultiLibraryInstallDialog.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;149&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;happens on macosx, don't know  why&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;183&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;show error error when importing. ignoring  :(&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../Base.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2423&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Improve / move error handling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../Editor.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1541&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Should be a Theme value?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../EditorHeader.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;78&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Should be a Theme value?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../EditorStatus.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Improve decoupling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.../EditorTab.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;465&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随后，我们只需要根据真实的情况，更新项目中的 Todo，以确认出我们需要完成的技术债务。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，写好一个 Todo 并不是容易，万一以后大家都不写了呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-测试和文档评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#测试和文档评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;测试和文档评估&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于测试的话题，我们会有一个大的专题来介绍相关的活动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;至于文档的缺乏，会在文中的最后介绍。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，你也可以参考我的那篇《&lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com/blog/build-trusted-software-system/" rel="nofollow"&gt;构建质量可信的软件系统&lt;/a&gt;》 来对你的文档进行评估。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-项目评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#项目评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;项目评估&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据不同的项目，侧重点有所不同。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是毫无疑问地，我们可以统计：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;功能的 bug 率，对应的 bug 修改时间&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bug 常见的问题&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你都懂的。我暂时就不 copy 了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-编写工具评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#编写工具评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;编写工具评估&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在我遇到的一个重构项目中，项目中经常抛出 Null Point Exception 的问题。于是，我便写了一个简单的工具，来查找项目中返回 null point exception 的代码，并对调用的地方进行评估。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随着评估的进一步深入，我在工具中加入了更多的功能，如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;静态方法多，难以进行测试。要么是工具类过多，需要抽取基础设施；要么就是缺乏 OO 设计，导致过程性代码……。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Util 过多，同上。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null Point Exeception 越多，则项目的出错可能性越多。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;类方法数的标准差，能判断出对应的上帝类情况。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;方法长度的标准差，越大则意味着方法的长度都比较长，方便于重构。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;只需要运行 &lt;code&gt;coca evaluate&lt;/code&gt;，就能得到以下的结果：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TYPE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;COUNT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;LEVEL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TOTAL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RATE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nullable / Return Null&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1615&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.00%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Utils&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;252&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.78%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Static Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1615&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.43%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Method Num.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1615&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method/Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;252&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.408730&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method Num. Std Dev / 标准差&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1615&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.344917&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Method Length&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13654&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Without Getter/Setter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12.412727&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method Length Std Dev / 标准差&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1615&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;20.047092&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;笑，你只要加强使用 TDD，那么上述的大部分问题，都能得到进一步的缓解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 世界流行的几个找问题工具：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FindBugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PMD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checkstyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;试试你就知道了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-真实的测试覆盖率" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#真实的测试覆盖率"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;真实的测试覆盖率&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尽管有越来越多的项目将测试覆盖率作为一项考核指标。但是，对于诸多编程实践本身就好的公司为说，测试覆盖率也往往不是真的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们编写测试的其中一个目的是用于快速反馈，即当我们的功能出现问题的时候，我们可以快速通过测试来定位到问题所。然而，如果那些是没有断言的测试，那么我们就无法通过它来进行快速反馈。即，如果我们重构过程中，修改了某一块的功能，可能会进一步导致出现 bug。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此，你可以借助于 Coca 的 Test Bas Smell 功能，来找到对应的问题。只需要执行 &lt;code&gt;coca tbs&lt;/code&gt;，便能帮助你找到代码中的坏味道。它可以在你进入重构之前，帮你看看是否有对应的风险。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如下是 Coca 扫描出来的 Arduino 开源项目测试问题：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;好在上述的测试代码中，没有出现诸如于下面场景的测试坏味道：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EmptyTest。测试函数里空空如也&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UnknownTest。测试中没有对应的断言&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IgnoreTest。测试是被 Ingore 的，即不会运行的测试。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果你的代码中出现了大量的上述问题，你需要好好反思一下，你的测试覆盖率是真实的吗？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我喜欢重构的那种感觉 —— 把一坨烂代码，训服成更易于阅读的代码。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;软件开发是一种团队活动，当组织缺&lt;strong&gt;乏强有力的&lt;/strong&gt;新鲜血液时，代码便会以相同的模式编写。该组织设计出来的架构，也从某种意义上出现了大量的趋同 —— 创新反而可能不好。在这种统一的模式之下，组织的代码也会呈现相似的坏味道。代码中的坏味道的模式也往往极为相似。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也因此，我们能快速地通过一小部分代码，了解整个项目的情况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此，我们只需要根据《重构：改善既有代码的设计》一书提出的 23 种代码坏味道，整理出系统中的常见坏味道。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;集合类型&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;坏味道&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;代码臃肿&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;过长函数，过大的类，基本类型偏执，过长参数列，数据泥团&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;滥用面向对象&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Switch 声明，临时字段，被拒绝的遗赠，异曲同工的类&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;变革的障碍&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;发散式变化，霰弹式修改，平行继承体系&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;非必要的&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;冗余类，纯稚的数据类，重复代码，夸夸其谈的未来性，注释&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;耦合&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;不完美的类库，依恋情结，狎昵关系，消息链，中间人&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;随后，我们便能有针对性地对代码进行重构。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-领域名词表" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#领域名词表"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;领域名词表&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据开发人员介绍的各种概念，抽象出一份系统的领域名词表。它的来源是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;项目的相关开发文档&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;项目中的架构资源&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;项目的代码&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也因此，当你需要到一个新的项目实施重构计划时，一定需要有一个能与你结对编程的人。一个领域专家，一个代码专家，双方的无间配合，才能快速落地完成重构工作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我们所要做的一个努力是，让文档、架构、元模型概念与代码实现一一对齐。这并不是一件容易的事情。从大多数项目的实践来看，架构师的设计和模型的实现往往是脱离的。因为设计架构的人和实现模型的人，往往不是同一些人。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我正在尝试根据它来编写这样的一个功能，但是它不是一件容易的事。只是呢，已经有一个小的雏形，通过 &lt;code&gt;coca concept&lt;/code&gt; 从函数名称中抽取出部分的对应模式&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;WORDS&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;COUNTS&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;blog&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;publish&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;entity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;domain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;published&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;resource&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;criteria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是，这只能是构建领域名词表的一个 hello, world，并不足以承担起真正的领域名词活动，也无法构建真正的领域名词表体系。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;除此，我还在寻找一种更高效的构建领域特定语言方式，它用于帮助我们高效地进行软件开发，这种社会学活动。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上述的代码是 Spring Framework 中最常修改的文件，前面三个文件看上去是合理的，但是 &lt;code&gt;AnnotationUtils.java&lt;/code&gt; 显然有问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对应的 &lt;code&gt;DefaultListableBeanFactory.java&lt;/code&gt; 也有 2000+ 行左右的规模。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从代码的行数和修改次数来看，它们都是上帝类，并且经常出现 Bug。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;从代码上来看，还是 Util 方法被引用得最多。似乎我们仍然需要一个更可靠的算法，来保证被引用的正常度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;尽管对于某些部分的重构来说，我们只是移动一下代码的位置 —— 如分层架构的调整，它不需要我们编写对应的测试。但是呢，出于流程完整性的考虑，这一步步往往流程比较长，毕竟它可以减少系统中 bug 的出现，降低重构的风险。与此同时，这是可以由团队一起协作完成的工作，特别适合于多人的协同重构方式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-防护网策略" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#防护网策略"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;防护网策略&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了&lt;strong&gt;保证对外暴露的 API 好的&lt;/strong&gt;，即我的重构不影响 API 的使用方，我们需要设计一个合适的防护策略。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在设计的时候，我们采用的是测试金字塔来帮助我们搭建测策略。我们会从下（单元测试）向上（集成测试）一步步搭建测试策略。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/test-primard.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/test-primard.png" alt="测试金字塔" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而当我们重构的时候，我们则是自顶向下设计防护策略。常见的测试策略有&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;框架/模式库测试。xUnit，xMock，如 Java 语言里的 JUnit, Mockito；JavaScript 中的 Jest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;端到端 API 测试。JMeter，Postman，Rest Assured，Karate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI 集成测试。Protractor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考虑到测试即文档，在实现实现的时候，会配合一些支持自然语言描述的框架，如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;文档式测试，Gauge （主流语言），Concordion（Java）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BDD 测试，Cucumber（主流语言）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATDD 测试，Robot Framework（Python 语言）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了与运行客户端一配合，我们还需要有底层 API 来控制浏览器、客户端应用：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appium。移动 APP 和桌面应用，支持主流语言&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selenium。Web 浏览器，支持主流语言&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puppeteer。Node.js API 操作 Chrome 浏览器&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;关于 APP 测试方案，可以参考我之前写的《&lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com/blog/phodal-architecture-101-mobile-appllication-test-architecture/" rel="nofollow"&gt;【架构拾集】移动应用的自动化测试（BDD 方式）&lt;/a&gt;》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;根据现有的 E2E（端到端）/集成测试框架的架构，我画了一个大致的测试策略分层架构图：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/test-arch.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/test-arch.png" alt="测试架构" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;选择适合你们团队的测试架构，然后编写你的第一个测试。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-第一个测试" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#第一个测试"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;第一个测试&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这个就简单了：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;选择方案，然后 Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;寻找最简单的情形，编写测试&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;只需要有了第一个，剩下的就是时间问题。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-持续集成重构" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#持续集成重构"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;持续集成重构&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果你还没有持续集成环境的话，那么请搭建它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考虑到这是一个体力活，而且这方面的资料已经足够的多，我就不浪费大家的时间了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;顺带一提，如果你的分支比较多，而且构建比较多，那么你可以考虑 &lt;code&gt;pipeline as pipeline&lt;/code&gt; 的方式进行构建。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-检视测试" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#检视测试"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;检视测试&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;某次代码重构中，我发现代码的测试覆盖率很高，过程中出了一些错误，重构手法不正确是一个问题。但是在重构的过程中，发现有些测试都是没有意义的，所以这让我意思到在构建防护网的时候，有必要审视一遍测试，查找测试代码中的坏味道。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;测试代码坏味道，是指单元测试代码中的不良编程实践（例如，测试用例的组织方式，实现方式以及彼此之间的交互方式），它们表明测试源代码中潜在的设计问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;常见的测试坏味道有：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;空的测试。测试是生成的，但是没有内容。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;忽略的测试。即测试被 Ignore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;没有断言的测试。为了测试覆盖率而出现的测试&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;多余的 Println。调试时留下的讯息。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;多重断言。每个测试函数只应该测试一个概念。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有兴趣进一步了解的话，可以阅读《&lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com/blog/test-bad-smell/" rel="nofollow"&gt;测试代码的坏味道&lt;/a&gt;》。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;也可以 &lt;code&gt;coca tbs&lt;/code&gt; 来查找测试中的坏味道：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;重量级 DDD 更多的是结合现状 + 未来出发，更多的人参与，提供准确的信息。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;轻量级 DDD 则是通过现状，只需要少数熟悉的人，没有完成一致的达成，通过&lt;strong&gt;持续性赋能&lt;/strong&gt;改善模型。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;产品线 / 业务线来说，并非每一个子系统都是核心域，也不会投入大量的人和精力在上面。特别是，当你在重构的时候，投入的人员和精力不足以实施一个合理的事件风暴，以完成对应的领域驱动设计活动。所以，我们只能尽可能完善系统的设计。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-高质量级-ddd-重构演进驱动的事件风暴" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#高质量级-ddd-重构演进驱动的事件风暴"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;高质量级 DDD 重构：演进驱动的事件风暴&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它意味着，重构时需要有：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;积极专注的团队参与&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;复杂的场景&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;领域专家参与协作&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;迭代式的模型设计&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为此需要：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;事件风暴&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;识别上下文&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;梳理上下文关系&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;划分问题子域&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;识别弹性边界&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;领域建模&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;分层架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对应的我们需要：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重搭架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;编写集成测试&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;搬移代码&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考虑到其复杂性，我建议采用《事件风暴设计工作坊》来完成相关的流程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-轻量级-ddd-重构现状驱动的领域方案" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#轻量级-ddd-重构现状驱动的领域方案"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;轻量级 DDD 重构：现状驱动的领域方案&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;有意思的一个现象是，在真正落地的时候，对于核心的系统往往会抱着比较谨慎的态度 —— 除非原来的模式真的有问题。又或者是，所处的部门不是系统的核心部门时，在投入在会出现一定的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;看图：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/quick-ddd.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/quick-ddd.png" alt="Quick ES" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;相应的步骤如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;结合工具识别所有的接口&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;通过接口识别出领域名词（聚合、实体等）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;分析接口设计是否合理&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;通过领域名词划分上下文边界&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重新定义领域名词&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;结合领域名词划分新的 API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;划分领域和分层架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重新划分分层架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重构 service 代码，剥离领域逻辑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;重构代码到领域模型&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于未采用 Swagger 等 API 管理工具的项目，可以通过 &lt;code&gt;coca api&lt;/code&gt; 生成 API 列表：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET   /aliyun/oss/policy                
POST  /aliyun/osscallback               
GET   /subject/list                     
GET   /esProduct/search                 
GET   /order/list                       
GET   /productAttribute/list/{cid}      
GET   /productCategory/list/{parentId}  
GET   /brand/list                       
GET   /esProduct/search/simple          
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-限界上下文要素" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#限界上下文要素"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;限界上下文要素&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;包含相关上下文的：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;实体，只要一个对象在生命周期中能够保持连续性，并且独立于它的属性（即使这些属性对系统用户非常重要），那它就是一个实体。它具有唯一标识和生命周期。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;值对象，当你只关心某个对象的属性时，该对象便可作为一个值对象。它是实体的附加业务概念，用来描述实体所包含的业务信息。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;领域服务（domain service）。封装了没有在模型中自然建模为值对象或实体的领域逻辑和概念。它的主要职责是使用实现和值对象编排业务逻辑。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;领域事件（domain event）。它用于表明问题域中发生了一些业务人员关心的事情。在命名领域事件时，我们往往选择动词的过去分词，以明确表达事件的属性，其中文形式往往是『XXX已YYY』。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;资源库（repository）。公开聚合根在内存中的集合的接口，提供聚合根的检索和持久化需要。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;工厂（factory）。即在实体或者值对象创建复杂时，可以委托给工厂（模式）进行创建。。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;聚合（aggregate）。是一种边界内的领域对象的集群，可以将其视为一个单元。可以封装一个到多个实体与值对象，用来维护该边界范围之内的业务完整性。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-微服务重构" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#微服务重构"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;微服务重构&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一旦涉及到对微服务进行重构的时候，我们有很大的可能性要对系统进行 API 的重构设计。它也意味着，我们可能会影响到 API 的使用方，如果 API 也是自己内部的系统，那么问题就不是太大；如果 API 的使用方是第三方团队的系统时，我们就需要考虑一下兼容方案。这种兼容方案会在一定程度上影响到我们的重构，甚至于我们有可能不对做这方面的重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;重构到微服务是一个巨大的挑战。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;微服务是一个生态系统，它需要大量的基础设施进行配合，如部署管道、服务发现、日志和监控、负责均衡等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果团队本身没有相关的经验，并且尝试往上调整的话，那么需要在心理上做好大量的准备。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果你的目标是重构到微服架构，那么我建议你先重构到 DDD + 整洁架构，它是微服务架构的一个中间态。即，先看看容器架构重构。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;待定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;由于笔者在这方面的经验不是非常丰富，但是我知道这里仍然有非常多的内容，可以探索。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;小步前进，拉一下最新的代码。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我在设计之初，想把标题改为容器架构重构，它对应上 C4 模型。纠结之后，我还是改为了服务架构。可见，命名之难。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Martin 总结了六边形架构（即端口与适配器架构）、DCI （Data-Context-Interactions，数据-场景-交互）架构、BCI（Boundary Control Entity，Boundary Control Entity）架构等多种架构，归纳出了这些架构的基本特点：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;框架无关性。系统不依赖于框架中的某个函数，框架只是一个工具，&lt;strong&gt;系统不能适应于框架&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;可被测试。业务逻辑脱离于 UI、数据库等外部元素进行测试。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI 无关性。不需要修改系统的其它部分，就可以变更 UI，诸如由 Web 界面替换成 CLI。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;数据库无关性。业务逻辑与数据库之间需要进行解耦，我们可以随意切换 LocalStroage、IndexedDB、Web SQL。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;外部机构（agency）无关性。系统的业务逻辑，不需要知道其它外部接口，诸如安全、调度、代理等。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如图所示 Clean Architecture 一共分为四个环，四个层级。环与环之间，存在一个依赖关系原则：&lt;strong&gt;源代码中的依赖关系，必须只指向同心圆的内层，即由低层机制指向高级策略&lt;/strong&gt;。其类似于 SOLID 中的依赖倒置原则：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;高层模块不应该依赖低层模块，两者都应该依赖其抽象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;抽象不应该依赖细节，细节应该依赖抽象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与此同时，四个环都存在各自核心的概念：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;实体 Entities （又称领域对象或业务对象，实体用于封装企业范围的业务规则）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;用例 Use Cases（交互器，用例是特定于应用的业务逻辑）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;接口适配器 Interface Adapters （接口适配器层的主要作用是转换数据）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;框架和驱动（Frameworks and Drivers），最外层由各种框架和工具组成，比如 Web 框架、数据库访问工具等
这个介绍可能有些简单，让我复制/粘贴一下更详细的解释：&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;实体（Entities）&lt;/strong&gt;，实体用于封装企业范围的业务规则。实体可以是拥有方法的对象，也可以是数据结构和函数的集合。如果没有企业，只是单个应用，那么实体就是应用里的业务对象。这些对象封装了最通用和高层的业务规则，极少会受到外部变化的影响。任何操作层面的改动都不会影响到这一层。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;用例（Use Cases）&lt;/strong&gt;，用例是特定于应用的业务逻辑，一般用来完成用户的某个操作。用例协调数据流向或者流出实体层，并且在此过程中通过执行实体的业务规则来达成用例的目标。用例层的改动不会影响到内部的实体层，同时也不会受外层的改动影响，比如数据库、UI 和框架的变动。只有而且应当应用的操作发生变化的时候，用例层的代码才随之修改。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;接口适配器（Interface Adapters）&lt;/strong&gt;。接口适配器层的主要作用是转换数据，数据从最适合内部用例层和实体层的结构转换成适合外层（比如数据持久化框架）的结构。反之，来自于外部服务的数据也会在这层转换为内层需要的结构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;框架和驱动（Frameworks and Drivers）&lt;/strong&gt;。最外层由各种框架和工具组成，比如 Web 框架、数据库访问工具等。通常在这层不需要写太多代码，大多是一些用来跟内层通信的胶水代码。这一层包含了所有实现细节，把实现细节锁定在这一层能够减少它们的改动对整个系统造成的伤害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根据不同项目的实际情况，在真正落地的时候，会存在一些细微的差距。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如我的同事 &lt;a href="https://github.com/huleTW"&gt;@huleTW&lt;/a&gt; 在 &lt;a href="https://github.com/huleTW/django-ddd-demo"&gt;django-ddd-demo&lt;/a&gt; 项目中使用的 Python + Django 下的 DDD 分层架构如下所示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;apis&lt;/strong&gt;：放各种 url 的 dispatcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;application&lt;/strong&gt;：放各种 use case，use case 只能访问 domain 里面的 domain service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;domain&lt;/strong&gt;：放各个聚合，各个聚合里面有一个 domain service，domain service 操作可以聚合根，包含业务逻辑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;：放读取数据（服务，中间件），以及公共的 util 包&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我的同事 &lt;a href="https://github.com/howiehu"&gt;@howiehu&lt;/a&gt; 在 &lt;a href="https://github.com/howiehu/ddd-architecture-samples"&gt;DDD Architecture Samples&lt;/a&gt; 项目中使用了整洁架构分层如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── adapters      适配器
│   ├── inbound   入站适配器
│   └── outbound  出站适配器
├── application   应用层
│   ├── concepts
│   ├── dto
│   ├── gateway
│   └── usecases  用例
└── domain        领域层
    ├── contexts  限界上下文
    └── core      核心概念
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因此对于整洁架构的外部适配器，人们通过有多种叫法 interfaces、apis、facades、presentation、adapters 等等，&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而诸如 application、domain 和 infrastructure 来说，命名上倒是没有太大的区别。但是在实现上还是有相当大的区别：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;粘合层（service）&lt;/strong&gt;。在 application 中的粘合层倒是有不同的叫法 service（application service）、usecases、interactors。但是在真正实施的时候，还会有巨大的差别，采用 service 可能会出现上帝类，于是就出现用例驱动的 xxxUsecase。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;瘦 application vs 胖 application&lt;/strong&gt;。采用 PresentationDomainDataLayering 架构，即瘦 application 层，会把用例放在 domain 中；而采用胖 application 架构，则会把 usecase 放在 application 中。两者的使用场景的区别，主要取决于 CRUD 的&lt;strong&gt;纯净度&lt;/strong&gt;。如果你有 BFF，那么瘦 application 层适合于你；如果你是单体，又或者是跨实体操作多，那么胖 application 层适合你。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，这些都不重要，重要的是要不要出现尖叫架构 —— 一看就懂得业务：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/screaming-architecture.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/screaming-architecture.png" alt="尖叫架构" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你只需要回答一个问题，你的场景复杂吗？复杂的话，你就拆 —— 将复杂问题繁杂化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;实施新分层架构是一个持续的过程，它需要配合后续的各种重构模式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-划分类移动代码" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#划分类移动代码"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;划分类，移动代码&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一步我们所做的是：移动旧的 service、controller、model 为竖直 + 水平架构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于大单体应用来说，从分层架构上，移到新的架构并不难：按各种层级创建应用，移动代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于微服务架构应该来说，这一步也不算麻烦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于原先模块划分不合理的应用来说，如：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── pom.xml
├── zheng-api-common
│   └── pom.xml
├── zheng-api-rpc-api
│   └── pom.xml
├── zheng-api-rpc-service
│   └── pom.xml
└── zheng-api-server
    └── pom.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因为包、类之间本身是根据技术维度来划分的，如果我们计划以业务维度重新开发时，便就得创建新的目录结构，再移入新的类包。但是这样做的一个问题是，中间存在一个不可恢复的状态，会在一定程度上影响重构效果。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-中间态分层" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#中间态分层"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;中间态分层&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;考虑到服务重构的难度，它会存在着一个长期的中间态分层架构。原因有很多：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;无法短期内重构完&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;未拆到正确位置的 API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;领域层中的 repository 未拆分&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，可以考虑将瘦 application 层作为中间态架构。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;是的，在这一步里，由于只是移动文件，所以只需要执行一下构建，你就能验证移动文件是否正确。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，由于有 IDEA 这样的工具上，想必不是问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然而，要是代码库过于庞大，那么我建议你试试 &lt;code&gt;coca refactor&lt;/code&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;小步前进，拉一下最新的代码。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;创建通用的共享组件导致了一系列问题，比如耦合、协调难度和复杂度增加。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我看到一个个巨大的 common 包时，我开始痛恨 &lt;code&gt;common&lt;/code&gt;、&lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;、&lt;code&gt;util&lt;/code&gt; 这些该死的包，还有它们目录下统一管理的 &lt;code&gt;bean&lt;/code&gt;。我们真的已经把它们用烂了，所以你应该重新审视一下你的项目代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，从这种意义上来说：&lt;strong&gt;复用与低耦合&lt;/strong&gt;，本身存在一定的互斥关系。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公共代码往往缺乏抽象，又或者是追求过度的复用。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-它真是个-util-吗" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#它真是个-util-吗"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;它真是个 util 吗？&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;哦，不，它是个恶魔，因为它是 util。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你会往 xxUtil 不加思索地扔入逻辑，正如你会往 common/bean 中扔入所有的 model，直次有一天，你拥有一个巨大无比的 base、common 代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;大多数情况下，所有和业务相关的 Util 都存在一定的问题，如 CaptchaUtil，它要么应该划到自己的上下文中去，要么扔到诸如于 domain/shared 等共享上下文，而不是和其它 util 放到一起。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而诸如 FileUtil、DateUtil、RedisUtil、JdbcUtil 这些都可以说是基础设施相关的部分，它们可以划到 infrastructure/file 又或者是 infrastructure/date 目录下，而不是统一的管理这些 util。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如 &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1866794/naming-classes-how-to-avoid-calling-everything-a-whatevermanager" rel="nofollow"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; 的相关问题所列，我们还有诸如 Coordinator、Builder、Writer、Reader、Handler、Container、Protocol、Target、Converter、Controller、View、Factory、Entity、Bucket 等名称。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;试着干掉 Util，你将收获更多的类，笑~。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utils / Helper 多数是恶魔，无法满足单一职责和开闭原则。好的 OO 设计，大部分的类只表示一个事物，及其所有属性和操作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;尽可能减少 Utils / Helper 类。好的 OO 设计，大部分的类只表示一个事物，及其所有属性和操作。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果使用一个 Util 用于操作类，如如 IList，那么它应该划到类中。除非该类不存在于当前的应用中。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Util 中的方法应该是无状态的，比如没有 static 变量。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;如果有大量的 utils 方法，应该把划分到类中，以便快速找到它们。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;当我们谈论 service 的时候，我们谈论的是同一个 service 吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我们谈论 model 的时候，我们谈论的是同一种 model 吗？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;若对于一个文法的某一句子存在两棵不同的语法树，则该文法是二义性文法。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果有多种不同类型的类，都被放置在 model 包下。那么，你应该消除 model 这个包，改为更表意的名称，如 Entity、Request、Response 等等。同理，一旦你们展开对某个名称的讨论时，是时候好好考虑其中的二义性。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;最后，你还需要有一个相关领域的名词表。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;避免产生二异性的词语。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;模块/组件是软件的部署单元，是整个软件系统在部署过程中可以&lt;strong&gt;独立部署&lt;/strong&gt;的最小实体。 —— 《架构整洁之道》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-组件聚合三原则" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#组件聚合三原则"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;组件聚合三原则&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在我们设计软件工程的时候，我们&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/components-rules.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/components-rules.png" alt="组件聚合" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob 大叔在书中提到了三个原则：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;复用/发布等同原则（REP）。软件复用的最小粒度等同于其发布的最小粒度。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;共同闭包原则（CCP）。我们应该将那些会同时修改，并且为相同目的而修改的类放到同一个组件中，而将不会同时修改，并且不会为了相同目的而修改的那些类放到不同组件中。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;共同复用原则（CRP）。不要强迫一个组件的用户依赖他们不需要的东西。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，其实按我的理解，第一条原则讲的是合理、有效的包发布策略；而后两条原则，只需要满足我们的模块/包满足开闭原则、单一职责，就可以合理地解决整个流程了。不过，这三个原则可以合理地解释在软件生命周期中，我们应该如何管理模块。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;因此，对于自家的模块只需要：&lt;strong&gt;根据技术、业务划分包，形成上下文边界，防止代码越界&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-打破包之间的依赖关系" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#打破包之间的依赖关系"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;打破包之间的依赖关系&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这一步理论上来看，倒也是蛮简单的：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;从 Gradle / Maven 找到想去除的依赖&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;全局搜索依赖的包名&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;解决依赖
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;提取到类库中&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;剥离并使用依赖注入&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;删除依赖的包&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;执行构建和 E2E 测试&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBC。工具还在写，目前主要要看人眼识别。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;为此，我们可能需要寻找一些合适的依赖注入框架：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java。Spring，Dagger 2，Guice 等等&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go。Facebook  Inject、Uber Dig、Google Wire 等&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对了，静态语言呢？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;不需要。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;架构元模型定义了模型中使用的概念和使用规则。 —— 《架构师修炼之道》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你可以将其对比于领域模型。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-聚合行为" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#聚合行为"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;聚合行为&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于领域模型来说，我们也无法直接在代码中实现架构元模型的所有概念。但是，我们所要做的事不断减少模型与代码之间的差异。如果我们不创建模式，而直接开始编写代码，那么我们会收获一堆上帝类。但是，反过来，当我们有一堆上帝类的时候，那么我们就需要从类中把行为都抽取出来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我们的贫血模型，拥有了行为，就可以进一步构成富血模型，符合面向对象（OO）的思想。进一步的，我们可以从业务的角度来考虑这个问题，将充血模型改为领域模型。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于那些已经采用 DDD 架构的项目来说，往往会遇到一些领域模型不完整、包含非领域相关代码等的情况。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;遇到这种情况时，可以尝试：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;由内到外剥离非模型相关代码。只需要浏览一遍领域模型相关的代码，然后剥离不属于模型的代码；通过依赖注入、工厂模式等方式，建立整洁的 domain 层。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;由外到内聚合领域模型相关逻辑。这是一个复杂的过程，需要每个使用到模型的调用方，再看是属于领域相关的行为。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;第一步可以在短期内快速实现，而第二步则需要一个漫长的过长 —— 取决于项目的大小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;笔者在某个重构项目中，遇到模型的创建逻辑很复杂 —— 参数多、场景多，所以做的第一件事情是：使用工厂模式优化了创建过程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;参考工厂模式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 DDD 中强调了统一语言的重要性，为此我们有必要对代码中的模型名称及其行为进行检视。在软件工程实践不好的团队中，你往往会出现&lt;strong&gt;对于同一个事件，往往会有多种命名方式&lt;/strong&gt;。哪怕你觉得它是不正确的，因为 ownership 的缺乏，也没有人来统一对应的命名。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，在我们决定继续往下走之前，先学习一下怎么命名。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;计算机科学只存在两个难题：缓存失效和命名。 —— Phil KarIton&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但是还是更习惯于原来的文章中的：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;阶段&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;解释&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;示例&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;空白&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;没有名称&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;doSomething()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;凑合&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称不能准确反应元素的含义&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;preload()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;沾边&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称至少反映了元素某一方面的功能&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DomSomethingEvilToDB()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;反映功能&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称直接描述了元素的所有功能&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ParseXmlAndStoreFightToDbAndLocalCacheAndStartProcessing()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;反映角色&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称充分地反映了元素在架构中的角色&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;StoreFightlightToDatabaseAndStartProcessing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;反映意图&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称不仅反映元素的功能，还能反映其目的。&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BeginTrackingFlight()&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;领域抽象&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;名称超越了单个元素本身，成为一个新的抽象概念。&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;MonitoringPanle.Add(new Flight())&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;偶然间，我看到我找到我书架上的《重构与模式》时，刚好看到一本《实现模式》，顺便看了看，发现书的内容对于本文有启发意义。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/implementation-patterns.png"&gt;&lt;img src="images/implementation-patterns.png" alt="《实现模式》概览" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;书中提及了四五种类型类、状态、消息与流（原行为）、方法，但是对于我们的统一语言工作来说，只需要重命名类、方法、状态就够了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对应的解释如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-类" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#类"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;类&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;数据的变化比逻辑要繁琐得多，正是这种现象让类有了存在的意义。—— 《实现模式》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对于继承的类来说，它应该遵循这么一些原则：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;超类名称要简单&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;子类名称要合格&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-状态" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#状态"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;状态&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;状态包含了变量、字段、常量、局部参数、参数、参数对象等等。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-方法" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#方法"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;方法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接下来就是处理剩下的 bean、model 等等模型。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在一个系统中，你会存在这么一些不同的 model：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;（PS：部分描述可能不准确，欢迎指正）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;与数据库表结构对应的 DO（ Data Object）/ PO(Persistant Object)。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;查询数据的 Query、Request。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对外传输的对象：DTO（ Data Transfer Object）。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;业务层之间的数据对象：VO（Value Object） / BO（Business Object)。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;访问数据库的：DAO (Data Access Object数据访问对象)。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;以及我们想要的 DDD 中的实体 Entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还有其它的 POJO（ Plain Ordinary Java Object）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是它们都是 model，所以它们都被扔到 model 中……，又或者是 bean 中……。导致，你有了一个巨大比的 model 层。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，在 DDD 又或者是 Clean Architecture，我们重新命名了不同的模式：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;使用 Command / Request 作为输入参数。其中的 Command 模式在完成后需要发出对应的 Event。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;使用 Response / DTO / Representation 作为返回结果。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;对 Entity 大家保持了一致的意见&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;还有 PO / DO 作为作为数据库的存储模型&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DAO 作为数据库的访问模型&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;……&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，其实你只要不再让使用 model 和 bean，相似会有更多地收获。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;过程不应该模型的一部分，但是它是领域的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如 Eric Evans 在所说，区分是否显式表达概念的关键在于：过程是否经常被领域专家谈起，又或者只是计算机程序机制的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;模式是某种场合下对某个问题的一个解决方案的&lt;strong&gt;一种结构化展现&lt;/strong&gt;。 ——  Jon Vlissides（GoF 成员）《设计模式沉思录》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;小步前进，拉一下最新的代码。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，人们对于设计模式的看法就变成了砒霜，听上去有害，实际上真香。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我不是想鼓励使用设计模式，只是呢，如开头所说，我想展示的是如何用它来提升代码的可读性。也因此，我们的第一个例子是，干掉反模式的设计模式。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一旦你决定使用某种设计模式的时候，请确保&lt;strong&gt;团队的所有人知道它解决了什么问题？&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;工厂是领域驱动设计中的重要组件。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;工厂的目标：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;隐藏创建对象的复杂性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;减少对外暴露过多的内部结构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;工厂模式是一种创建方法：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;工厂方法（factory method）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;抽象工厂（abstracty factory）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;建造者模式（builder）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;值得注意的是：工厂并不总是需要独立的静态类。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;尝试使用 &lt;code&gt;coca suggest&lt;/code&gt; 会有惊喜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对应的手法是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;提取构建步骤到新的构建方法中&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将构建步骤方法转为 static 方法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将这个 static 方法移到工厂类中&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将旧的构建函数提取成工厂方法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将提取的工厂方法移到类中&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内联原有的工厂使用方&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;常见的富血模型的类，往往包含了系统的行为。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;常见的原因是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;缺乏抽象&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;过程代码&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;行为无法附着&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从技巧上来说，主要是&lt;strong&gt;提取、内联与移动&lt;/strong&gt;，配合上 IDE 的重构功能和《重构：改善既有代码的设计》，那么剩下的事件就简单了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;内联上的手法则是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内联参数&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内联变量&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内联常量&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;内联方法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-手法移动" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#手法移动"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;手法：移动&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;移动的关键不在于&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-方法移至其它类中" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#方法移至其它类中"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;方法移至其它类中&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里的 Ctrl + T 对应于老式的 IDEA 快捷键 Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将函数转为静态方法，以解除对外的依赖（可选）（Static Method，Ctrl + T）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将与函数职责无关的部分提取为函数的参数（Extract Functional Parameter，Ctrl + T）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将函数的参数提取为参数对象（Extract Parameter Object，Ctrl + T）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;将函数移到参数对象中（Move Instance Method, F6）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;完美。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-标准4-行的方法" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#标准4-行的方法"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;标准：4 行的方法&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;偶然间然《修改代码的艺术：构建易维护代码的 9 条最佳实践》上看到了那句：『理想的方法长度不应该超过 4 行代码』。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，我找出了书架上的那本《代码整洁之道》，找到了出处 32 页。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;函数不该有 100 行那么长，20 行封顶最佳。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;然后就是 Kent Beck 的 Java/Swing 小程序四行的故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是，要保持一个好的习惯，寻找合适的机会去重构它。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-重构示例" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#重构示例"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;重构示例&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我正在寻找一个合适的项目来演示如何重构。事实上，我已经找到了一些，但是它们的复杂度不太适合在些教学，所以我正在努力简化出一个可用的版本。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果你已经迫不急待的话，可以尝试对以下的项目进行重构：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/shuzheng/zheng"&gt;https://github.com/shuzheng/zheng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/macrozheng/mall"&gt;https://github.com/macrozheng/mall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它们是我在 GitHub 上找到的 Star 数相当多的开源 Java 项目，所以让我们来进行评估吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这两个项目的作者在项目中展示了极高的专业性和原则性。无论怎么说，这都是“好代码”，我也并非出于恶意的目的。如果你看了我在 GitHub 上的项目，你也会对我有诸多吐槽。我所尝试去做的是，以专业眼光来检视问题，不多也不和。作为一个追求匠艺的手工艺人，我们应该欢迎别人对我们这么做。只有批评才能让我们学到更多的东西。在进一步的重构之前，我们要再一次感谢两位作者将代码免费给社区的勇气和信心。他们做得相当的好。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;相比之下，我大抵就只会复制和粘贴内容。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;开始之前，你大可以从 GitHub 上复制这两个项目的其中一个，然后这里的例子以 mall 为例。你可以将 zheng 作为你的练手项目。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;评估&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这两个项目都有丰富的文档，足够让你搭建好它们的环境。事实上，我觉得你可能不需要这样的操作，你需要打开你的 Intellij IDEA，然后构建一下，就可以阅读代码了。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-c4-模型展开" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#c4-模型展开"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;C4 模型展开&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;首先，让我们以 C4 模型来展开这个项目的代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;展开系统目录结构&lt;/strong&gt;。从目录结构上来看，mall 系统的组织相当的不错，按业务和通用模块进行了拆分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;├── mall-common -- 工具类及通用代码
├── mall-mbg -- MyBatisGenerator生成的数据库操作代码
├── mall-security -- SpringSecurity封装公用模块
├── mall-admin -- 后台商城管理系统接口
├── mall-search -- 基于Elasticsearch的商品搜索系统
├── mall-portal -- 前台商城系统接口
└── mall-demo -- 框架搭建时的测试代码
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;展开其中的一个微服务&lt;/strong&gt;。这里以 mall 为例，这是典型的 controller-service-dao 架构：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mall-admin
├── bo
├── component
├── config
├── controller
├── dao
├── dto
├── service
└── validator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;而其中的 &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; 包，又以&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;展开包架构&lt;/strong&gt;。接着，让我们看看 controller 包下的目录结构，这是按技术划分服务的架构模式：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;controller
...
├── SmsFlashPromotionController.java
├── SmsFlashPromotionProductRelationController.java
├── SmsFlashPromotionSessionController.java
├── SmsHomeAdvertiseController.java
├── SmsHomeBrandController.java
├── SmsHomeNewProductController.java
├── SmsHomeRecommendProductController.java
├── SmsHomeRecommendSubjectController.java
├── UmsAdminController.java
├── UmsMemberLevelController.java
├── UmsPermissionController.java
└── UmsRoleController.java
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;展开类&lt;/strong&gt;。接着，让我们查看一下 OmsOrderReturnApplyController.java 文件，看看最后的接口：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@ApiOperation&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;修改申请状态&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;/update/status/{id}&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;RequestMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@ResponseBody&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;CommonResult&lt;/span&gt; updateStatus(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@PathVariable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; id, &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@RequestBody&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;OmsUpdateStatusParam&lt;/span&gt; statusParam) {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; count &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; returnApplyService&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;updateStatus(id, statusParam);
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (count &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;) {
        &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;CommonResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;success(count);
    }
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;CommonResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;failed();
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;用 OmsUpdateStatusParam 封装了请求参数，这个实践相当的不错。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接着，我们进入 &lt;code&gt;updateStatus&lt;/code&gt; 方法看看：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; updateStatus(&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt; id, &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;OmsUpdateStatusParam&lt;/span&gt; statusParam) {
    &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; status &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getStatus();
    &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;OmsOrderReturnApply&lt;/span&gt; returnApply &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;OmsOrderReturnApply&lt;/span&gt;();
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(status&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;equals(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)){
        &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;确认退货&lt;/span&gt;
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setId(id);
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setStatus(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setReturnAmount(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getReturnAmount());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setCompanyAddressId(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getCompanyAddressId());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setHandleTime(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setHandleMan(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getHandleMan());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setHandleNote(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getHandleNote());
    }&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(status&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;equals(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)){
        &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;完成退货&lt;/span&gt;
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setId(id);
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setStatus(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;);
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setReceiveTime(&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setReceiveMan(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getReceiveMan());
        returnApply&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setReceiveNote(statusParam&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getReceiveNote());
    }
		&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;嗯，这是一个典型的贫血模型设计，这些业务逻辑都可以内聚到领域模型中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，我们有了初步的结论，可以尝试的内容：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;典型三层架构。可以业务维度重新做分层架构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;贫血模型。可以重构到充血模型&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;执行一下 &lt;code&gt;coca cloc&lt;/code&gt; 可以看看项目的行数统计：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;先执行一下 &lt;code&gt;coca analysis&lt;/code&gt;，然后 &lt;code&gt;coca evalute&lt;/code&gt;，得到一个基本的情况&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TYPE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;COUNT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;LEVEL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;TOTAL&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RATE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nullable / Return Null&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.15%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Utils&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;604&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.33%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Static Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.01%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Method Num.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method/Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;604&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22.776490&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method Num. Std Dev / 标准差&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Class&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;52.137890&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Method Length&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;46177&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Without Getter/Setter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11218&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.116331&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method Length Std Dev / 标准差&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13757&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.928149&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从数据上看，静态方法只有 7 个，返回 null 的情况有 21 个，保持得不错。项目的平均方法长度也还行，就是平均方法有点多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-代码坏味道评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#代码坏味道评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;代码坏味道评估&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;接着试试 &lt;code&gt;coca bs -s=type&lt;/code&gt; 来查看代码中的常见坏味道，限于篇幅的原因这里就不复杂了，说主要问题：大的类一共有 72 个，其中 OmsOrderExample.java 类，在没有 set/get 的情况下有 576 个方法。查看了一下引用情况，好像是来看数据库查询用的……：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Criteria&lt;/span&gt; andProductSnLike(&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; value) {
    addCriterion(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;product_sn like&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, value, &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;productSn&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Criteria&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;;
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这要重构的话是个体力活，详细见 &lt;a href="coca_reporter/bs.json"&gt;coca_reporter/bs.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-架构评估" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#架构评估"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;架构评估&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;执行了一下 &lt;code&gt;coca arch&lt;/code&gt;，由于是扁平的三层架构，没有太多的问题。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;执行 &lt;code&gt;coca api -c -r com.macro.mall.&lt;/code&gt; 获得基本的 API 列表情况：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;SIZE&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;METHOD&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;URI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CALLER&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/prefrenceArea/listAll&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;GET&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/subject/list&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.CmsSubjectController.getList&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/minio/upload&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.MinioController.upload&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/minio/delete&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.MinioController.delete&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;controller.OmsOrderController.list&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/order/update/delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.OmsOrderController.delivery&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;POST&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/order/update/close&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.OmsOrderController.close&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;/order/delete&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;controller.OmsOrderController.delete&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这里的 size 指的是调用的方法里，这里的 MinioController 的 upload 方法里一共调用了 28 个方法，打开一看：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@ApiOperation&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;文件上传&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;@RequestMapping&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;/upload&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;RequestMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;)

        &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
        minioClient&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;putObject(&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;BUCKET_NAME&lt;/span&gt;, objectName, file&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getInputStream(), file&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;getContentType());
        &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;LOGGER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;info(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;文件上传成功!&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;p&gt;嗯，它可能需要一个 service，而考虑到 Minio 是一个云存储服务器，还需要通过接口来封装这些细节。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在生成 API 结果之后，可以打开 &lt;code&gt;coca_reporter/arch.svg&lt;/code&gt; 查看项目的架构图。不过，由于项目的 API 较多，便需要一个个分析，所以你可以通过 &lt;code&gt;coca api -c -r com.macro.mall. -a /order&lt;/code&gt; 查看 /order 的所有接口情况：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;执行 &lt;code&gt;coca count&lt;/code&gt; 可以查看高引用的方法：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;REFS COUNT&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;p&gt;看上去，主要问题还在数据库查询语句拼接那一部分。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;执行 &lt;code&gt;coca git -t&lt;/code&gt; 可以查看经常修改的文件：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;ENTITYNAME&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;REVSCOUNT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;AUTHORCOUNT&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;README.md&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;121&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;document/pdm/mall.pdm&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;document/pdm/mall.pdb&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mall-admin/pom.xml&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mall-portal/pom.xml&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;document/sql/mall.sql&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mall-portal/src/main/java/com/macro/mall/portal/service/impl/OmsPortalOrderServiceImpl.java&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;mall-admin/src/main/java/com/macro/mall/controller/PmsBrandController.java&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;document/docker/docker-deploy.md&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;经常修改的地方是 pom 文件和文档，看上去没啥问题。考虑到 &lt;code&gt;OmsPortalOrderServiceImpl.java&lt;/code&gt; 文件修改了 16 次，我决定打开这个文件看看：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;有一个 150 行左右的方法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;总行数 643 行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明显这是一个订单相关的上帝类，关联的 OmsOrder 模型有 40 ~ 50 左右的字段。毫无疑问，这里就是代码中经常出现问题的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;执行了 &lt;code&gt;coca tbs&lt;/code&gt;，一共找到了这几个文件&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;数据库重构，是对数据库 schema 的一个简单变更，在保持其行为语义和信息语义的同时，改进了它的设计。 —— 《数据库重构》&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;换言之，你既没有增加新功能，也没有破坏原有的功能，没有添加新的数据，也没有改变原有数据的语义。值得注意的是，尽管你的领域模型发生了变化，但是这也不意味着数据库 schema 需要因此而发生改变；与此同时，一些公司的制度也会限制我们对数据库进行重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;它们之间的关系如下图所示：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="images/modeling.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="images/modeling.jpg" alt="Modeling" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如《数据库重构》一书所说：数据库重构是一种数据库实现技术，就像代码重构是一种应用实现技术一样。当我们在不断对代码调优的同时，我们也在不断地对数据库进行调优。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;采用传统的数据库测试工具，如 DBUnit，SQLUnit，通过诸如 TDD 的方式来完成对数据库的测试，随后开展对代码的重构。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-后测试" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#后测试"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;后测试&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;为了对重构进行验证，我们需要对数据库进行回归测试。一种常见的做法是：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;录制行为数据&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;通过回复验证功能不被破坏&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;通过影子流量进行验证&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这样的工具有很多，如我司吴大师写的 &lt;a href="https://github.com/XuefengWu/dbdiff"&gt;DBdiff&lt;/a&gt;，可以用于 Oracle 数据库的迁移。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;尽管，我并没有实践过大规模的数据库重构，但是和其他/她的后端开发一样，在日常的开发中，我们也时不时会做一些数据库重构 —— 数据库迁移。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;代码版本控制&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;数据库版本控制&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;多数据识别&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;诸如于 Flyway 和 Liquibase 都是一些不错的工具。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我尝试编写脚本来将我的博客 &lt;a href="https://www.phodal.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.phodal.com&lt;/a&gt; 从 SQLite3 迁移到 MySQL，这并不是一件困难的事情。因为 SQLite3 是一种嵌入式数据库，而我们可以通过 &lt;code&gt;mysqldump&lt;/code&gt; 出 MySQL 的数据。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如此一来，我们便可以用于做数据库重构练习，并编写数据库的回归测试。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于采用 Oracle 的项目来说，数据重构不是一件容易的事情。它还涉及到一系列的存储过程代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;所以，我们还可以尝试将 PLSQL 转为 Kotlin 代码：&lt;a href="https://github.com/XuefengWu/LADE_Analysis"&gt;https://github.com/XuefengWu/LADE_Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在重构的过程中，我们也可以尝试将它引入到系统中使用。它可以作为我们的架构适应度函数，不断地见证我们架构的变化和成长 —— 以一种肉眼的方式持续演进。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-测试驱动开发" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#测试驱动开发"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;测试驱动开发&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;测试驱动开发适合于解决复杂的问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我并不是一个 TDD 的死忠粉，但是我发现 TDD 非常适合于解决复杂问题。在这个场景下，我有一堆事先准备好的 Test Bad Smell，它们拥有一些对应的检测规则，这些规则相互之间存在一些影响。因此，我将这些 Bad Smell 作为我的测试用例：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;AssertionRouletteTest.java
ConditionalTest.java
ConstructorInitializationTest.java
DuplicateAssertTest.java
EmptyTest.java
IgnoreTest.java
MagicNumberTest.java
MysteryGuestTest.java
RedundantAssertionTest.java
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;于是，我可以写出我的第一个测试：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-java"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;func TestTbsApp_EmptyTest(t &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;testing&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;) {
	g &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; NewGomegaWithT(t)
	var codePath &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;../../../_fixtures/tbs/code/EmptyTest.java&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

	var result &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; buildTbsResult(codePath)

	&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;g&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Expect&lt;/span&gt;(result[&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;To(Equal(&lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;EmptyTest&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;))
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;对应的一步步完成出整个功能的代码。而后，我们就可以重构出理想的代码 —— 因为我们已经有了对应的测试。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如我们所见，我们在不同的公司里，会看到不同的人写出来的代码水平是不一样的。比如有一些是由供应商写的代码&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不过，既然给这引起供应商的工资本身就不高，那么怎么能指望出他/她写出好的代码。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;与此同时，由于种种原因，教他们学习的成本又特别高，甚至于你还要担心如果你教会了供应商，他/她们可能寻找一个新的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;行为驱动开发是一种敏捷软件开发的技术，它鼓励软件项目中的开发者、QA 和非技术人员或商业参与者之间的协作。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;年轻的时候（我刚毕业），我并不懂得 BDD 的好处——相当的繁琐，到了现在我又有一番不一样的体会。思来想去主要的原因是，当时我们是一个全功能的团队，不存在跨部门协作，也因此我并不觉得 BDD 能为我们带来多大的好处。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;可是在 ThoughtWorks 公司之外，开发、测试和业务都是各自的部门，有着各自的利益。通过 BDD 的协作方式，可以让交付物有一个一致的观点。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;重构比重写来得更有价值。重写往往有可能带来更多的技术债，还可能犯上同样的错误。&lt;/p&gt;

  Welcome to Kodi Home Theater Software!
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodi is an award-winning &lt;strong&gt;free and open source&lt;/strong&gt; software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. Available as a native application for &lt;strong&gt;Android, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS, and Windows operating systems&lt;/strong&gt;, Kodi runs on most common processor architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in 2003 by a group of like minded programmers, Kodi is a non-profit project run by the XBMC Foundation and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 500 software developers have contributed to Kodi to date, and 100-plus translators have worked to expand its reach, making it available in more than 70 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kodi functions very well as a standard media player application for your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC. With its &lt;strong&gt;beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine&lt;/strong&gt;, Kodi feels very natural to use from the couch with a remote control and is the ideal solution for your home theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi can be used to play almost all popular audio and video formats around. It was designed for network playback, so you can stream your multimedia from anywhere in the house or directly from the internet using practically any protocol available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point Kodi to your media and watch it &lt;strong&gt;scan and automagically create a personalized library&lt;/strong&gt; complete with box covers, descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow functions, a weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations. Once installed, your computer or HTPC will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi's developers work hard to make it support a large range of devices and operating systems. We provide final as well as development builds. To get started, head over to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/download" rel="nofollow"&gt;downloads section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and simply select the platform that you want to install it on. A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.wiki/view/quick_start_guide" rel="nofollow"&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to help you get acquainted with Kodi is available in our wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi is created by users for users and &lt;strong&gt;we welcome every contribution&lt;/strong&gt;. There are no highly paid developers or poorly paid support personnel on the phones ready to take your call. There are only users who have seen a problem and done their best to fix it. This means Kodi will always need the contributions of users like you. How can you get involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers can help Kodi by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues"&gt;fixing a bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, adding new features, making our technology smaller and faster and making development easier for others. Kodi's codebase consists mainly of C++ with small parts written in a variety of coding languages. Our add-ons mainly consist of python and XML. For more information, please have a look at our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="docs/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contributing guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping users:&lt;/strong&gt; Our support process relies on enthusiastic contributors like you to help others get the most out of Kodi. The #1 priority is always answering questions in our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://forum.kodi.tv/" rel="nofollow"&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Everyday new people discover Kodi, and everyday they are virtually guaranteed to have questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Localization:&lt;/strong&gt; Translate &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.com/teamxbmc/kodi-main/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.com/teamxbmc/xbmc-addons/" rel="nofollow"&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.com/teamxbmc/xbmc-skins/" rel="nofollow"&gt;skins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; into your native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add-ons:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/addons" rel="nofollow"&gt;Add-ons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are what make Kodi the most extensible and customizable entertainment hub available. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/create-an-addon" rel="nofollow"&gt;Get started building an add-on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Kodi's &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.wiki/" rel="nofollow"&gt;wiki pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are the hub for information about Kodi and surrounding ecosystem. Help make our documentation better by writing new content or correcting existing material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not enough free time?&lt;/strong&gt; No problem! There are other ways to help Kodi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread the word:&lt;/strong&gt; Share Kodi with the world! Tell your friends and family about how Kodi creates an amazing entertainment experience. Stay up to date on the latest stories about Kodi reading our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; section, follow us on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/koditv" rel="nofollow"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/XBMC/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;star Kodi's repo&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to follow development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donate:&lt;/strong&gt; We are always happy to receive a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/contribute/donate" rel="nofollow"&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Donations are typically used for travel to attend conferences, any necessary paperwork and legal fees, and the yearly XBMC Foundation Developers Conference, where a great deal of coding and planning for the following year occurs. Donations may also be used to purchase necessary hardware and licenses for developers, along with t-shirts, stickers, and other accessories for conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Kodi merchandise:&lt;/strong&gt; Purchasing Kodi gear helps just as much as a donation, and you get something in return! Checkout our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodi.tv/store" rel="nofollow"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for Kodi branded gear. We regularly add new products so check back often.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kodi uses CMake as its building system but instructions are highly dependent on your operating system and target platform. Fortunately &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="docs/README.md"&gt;we've got you covered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verifique se você instalou o &lt;code&gt;expo-cli&lt;/code&gt; e se foi configurado corretamente no seu &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para mais informações sobre como instalar o &lt;code&gt;expo-cli&lt;/code&gt; verifique &lt;a href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a documentação&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esse erro ocorre principalmente no Windows por conta de pastas que possuem espaços, pontos, acentos ou outros caracteres inválidos (ex: "Semana Omnistack" ou "C:\Users\João Pedro"). Para evitar esse erro, recomendamos que crie seu projeto na raíz do seu drive, por exemplo: "C:\SemanaOmnistack".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esse erro também pode ser encontrado caso você esteja utilizando a versão 12+ do NodeJs, nesse caso, basta fazer o &lt;em&gt;downgrade&lt;/em&gt; para a versão 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alguns terminais (git bash, por exemplo) podem bloquear a interatividade das CLIs. Inicie seu projeto com o comando: &lt;code&gt;expo init mobile --template blank&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifique se seu computador e seu celular estão na mesma rede;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurações de firewall podem influenciar:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mude a configuração da sua rede de WiFi de "Pública" para "Privada" e inicie seu projeto do expo novamente;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rode o comando &lt;code&gt;yarn start&lt;/code&gt; ou &lt;code&gt;expo start&lt;/code&gt; através do terminal do seu computador ao invés de usar o terminal embutido do VSCode;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMWare ou VirtualBox ou Docker podem influenciar na hora do Expo criar um endereço IP, se estiver com algum destes serviços rodando, altere a conexão de LAN para Tunnel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altere a conexão de LAN pra Tunnel;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifique método pelo qual você está tentando acessar aplicação. Caso opte pelo método &lt;strong&gt;LAN&lt;/strong&gt;, verifique se o IP é no formato 192.x.x.x, se não, troque para esse formato e tente acessar a aplicação novamente. Exemplo: &lt;code&gt;exp://192.168.0.5:19000&lt;/code&gt;. Se o erro persistir, opte pela conexão do tipo &lt;strong&gt;Tunnel&lt;/strong&gt; lá na pagina do Expo e utilize a URL/QR Code disponibilizado.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altere o seguinte campo no seu Model de Spot para mostrar seu IP ao invés de localhost:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O Expo muda a cor da barra de status do Android para transparente por padrão, e isso faz com que o comportamento dos elementos funcione igual no iOS, porém a SafeAreaView não funciona no Android. A forma mais rápida de resolver isso é adicionando as seguintes linhas no seu arquivo &lt;code&gt;app.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{
  &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;expo&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-c"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;adicione as linhas abaixo&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;androidStatusBar&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; {
      &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;barStyle&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;dark-content&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
      &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;backgroundColor&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;#ffffff&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    },
  }
}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Após este processo, pare o processo do Metro Bundler do Expo apertando Ctrl + C no terminal que está rodando, e &lt;strong&gt;inicie novamente&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Em dispositivos Linux, o sistema pode ter uma certa limitação para o uso do live reload, o que ocasiona esse erro quando o diretório de algum projeto com a função ativada possui muitos arquivos. Execute o comando &lt;code&gt;echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc sysctl.conf &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo sysctl -p&lt;/code&gt; em seu terminal e o problema será resolvido.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-keyboardavoidingview-não-funciona-no-android" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keyboardavoidingview-não-funciona-no-android"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KeyboardAvoidingView não funciona no Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caso o componente &lt;strong&gt;KeyboardAvoidingView&lt;/strong&gt; não tenha o comportamento esperado no &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, ajustar o &lt;em&gt;layout&lt;/em&gt; quando o teclado é exibido. Você pode tentar passar o parâmetro &lt;code&gt;behavior&lt;/code&gt; como &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, pois em dispositivos &lt;em&gt;Android&lt;/em&gt; ele se comportará melhor sem o &lt;code&gt;behavior&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-js"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; {&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;KeyboardAvoidingView&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;react-native&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;KeyboardAvoidingView behavior&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;{&lt;span class="pl-smi"&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;ios&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-s"&gt;&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;padding&lt;span class="pl-pds"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; outros componentes &lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;KeyboardAvoidingView&lt;span class="pl-k"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
