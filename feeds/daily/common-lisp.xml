Welcome to SBCL.

If you'd like to install or build the system, see the "INSTALL" file.

To find out more about who created the system, see the "CREDITS" file.

If you'd like information about the legalities of copying the system,
see the "COPYING" file.

If you'd like more information about using the system, see the man
page, "sbcl.1", or the user manual in the "doc/manual" subdirectory of
the distribution. (The user manual is maintained as Texinfo in the
source distribution; HTML version is available for download, and
"INSTALL" describes how to build the Texinfo version in HTML and PDF.)

The system is a work in progress. See the "TODO" file in the source
distribution for some highlights.

The "BUGS" file lists current known bugs.

If you'd like to make suggestions, report a bug, or help to improve the
system, please send mail to one of the mailing lists:
  sbcl-help@lists.sourceforge.net
  sbcl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
Note that as a spam reduction measure you must subscribe to the lists
before you can post.

The "HACKING" file has more details regarding hacking on and
contributing to SBCL.

SYSTEM-SPECIFIC HINTS

for OpenBSD 6.0 and newer:
  SBCL must be built and run from a filesystem with the "wxallowed"
  mount option, such as /usr/local in the default install.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>sbcl</author><guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
