&lt;p&gt;rav1e is an AV1 video encoder. It is designed to eventually cover all use cases, though in its current form it is most suitable for cases where libaom (the reference encoder) is too slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;-specific optimizations require a recent version of &lt;a href="https://nasm.us/" rel="nofollow"&gt;NASM&lt;/a&gt; and are enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to build, test and link to the codec with the default features on UNIX on &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;, you need NASM. To install this on Ubuntu or Linux Mint, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt install nasm&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, a &lt;a href="https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/" rel="nofollow"&gt;NASM binary&lt;/a&gt; in your system PATH is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build release binary in &lt;code&gt;target/release/rav1e&lt;/code&gt; run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-batchfile"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id="user-content-target-specific-builds" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-specific-builds"&gt;&lt;svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Target-specific builds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rust autovectorizer can produce a binary that is about 6%-7% faster if it can use &lt;code&gt;avx2&lt;/code&gt; in the general code, you may allow it by issuing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RUSTFLAGS="-C target-features=+avx2,+fma" cargo build --release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting binary will not work on cpus that do not sport the same set of SIMD extensions enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encoder output should be compatible with any AV1 decoder compliant with the v1.0.0 specification. You can build compatible aomdec using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkdir aom_test
&lt;span class="pl-c1"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; aom_test
cmake /path/to/aom -DAOM_TARGET_CPU=generic -DCONFIG_AV1_ENCODER=0 -DENABLE_TESTS=0 -DENABLE_DOCS=0 -DCONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH=1

&lt;p&gt;rav1e has several optional features that can be enabled by passing --features to cargo test. Passing --all-features is discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asm - enabled by default. When enabled, assembly is built for the platforms supporting it.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires &lt;code&gt;nasm&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires &lt;code&gt;gas&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;aarch64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mal is a learning tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each implementation of mal is separated into
11 incremental, self-contained (and testable) steps that demonstrate
core concepts of Lisp. The last step is capable of self-hosting
(running the mal implementation of mal). See the &lt;a href="process/guide.md"&gt;make-a-lisp process
guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The make-a-lisp steps are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step0"&gt;step0_repl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step1"&gt;step1_read_print&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step2"&gt;step2_eval&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step3"&gt;step3_env&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step4"&gt;step4_if_fn_do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step5"&gt;step5_tco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step6"&gt;step6_file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step7"&gt;step7_quote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step8"&gt;step8_macros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#step9"&gt;step9_try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="process/guide.md#stepA"&gt;stepA_mal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each make-a-lisp step has an associated architectural diagram. That elements
that are new for that step are highlighted in red.
Here is the final diagram for &lt;a href="process/guide.md#stepA"&gt;step A&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="process/stepA_mal.png"&gt;&lt;img src="process/stepA_mal.png" alt="stepA_mal architecture" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in creating a mal implementation (or just
interested in using mal for something), please drop by the #mal
channel on freenode. In addition to the &lt;a href="process/guide.md"&gt;make-a-lisp process
guide&lt;/a&gt; there is also a &lt;a href="docs/FAQ.md"&gt;mal/make-a-lisp
FAQ&lt;/a&gt; where I attempt to answer some common questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mal was presented publicly for the first time in a lightning talk at
Clojure West 2014 (unfortunately there is no video). See
examples/clojurewest2014.mal for the presentation that was given at the
conference (yes, the presentation is a mal program).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Midwest.io 2015, Joel Martin gave a presentation on Mal titled
"Achievement Unlocked: A Better Path to Language Learning".

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to run any given implementation is to use docker.
Every implementation has a docker image pre-built with language
dependencies installed. You can launch the REPL using a convenient
target in the top level Makefile (where IMPL is the implementation
directory name and stepX is the step to run):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL^stepX"
    # OR stepA is the default step:
make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ada implementation was developed with GNAT 4.9 on debian. It also
compiles unchanged on windows if you have windows versions of git,
GNAT and (optionally) make.  There are no external dependencies
(readline not implemented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd ada

&lt;p&gt;The BASIC implementation uses a preprocessor that can generate BASIC
code that is compatible with both C64 BASIC (CBM v2) and QBasic. The
C64 mode has been tested with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kanaka/cbmbasic"&gt;cbmbasic&lt;/a&gt; (the patched version is
currently required to fix issues with line input) and the QBasic mode
has been tested with &lt;a href="http://www.qb64.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;qb64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate C64 code and run it using cbmbasic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd basic
make stepX_YYY.bas
STEP=stepX_YYY ./run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate QBasic code and load it into qb64:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd basic
make MODE=qbasic stepX_YYY.bas
./qb64 stepX_YYY.bas
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sjsyrek"&gt;Steven Syrek&lt;/a&gt; for the original
inspiration for this implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC BASIC V implementation can run in the Brandy interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd bbc-basic
brandy -quit stepX_YYY.bbc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in ARM BBC BASIC V under RISC OS 3 or later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C implementation of mal requires the following libraries (lib and
header packages): glib, libffi6, libgc, and either the libedit or GNU readline
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd c

&lt;p&gt;The C++ implementation of mal requires g++-4.9 or clang++-3.5 and
a readline compatible library to build. See the &lt;code&gt;cpp/README.md&lt;/code&gt; for
more details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd cpp

&lt;p&gt;The C# implementation of mal has been tested on Linux using the Mono
C# compiler (mcs) and the Mono runtime (version 2.10.8.1). Both are
required to build and run the C# implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd cs

&lt;p&gt;The PL/pgSQL implementation of mal requires a running PostgreSQL server
(the "kanaka/mal-test-plpgsql" docker image automatically starts
a PostgreSQL server). The implementation connects to the PostgreSQL server
and create a database named "mal" to store tables and stored
procedures. The wrapper script uses the psql command to connect to the
server and defaults to the user "postgres" but this can be overridden
with the PSQL_USER environment variable. A password can be specified
using the PGPASSWORD environment variable. The implementation has been
tested with PostgreSQL 9.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PL/SQL implementation of mal requires a running Oracle DB
server (the "kanaka/mal-test-plsql" docker image automatically
starts an Oracle Express server). The implementation connects to the
Oracle server to create types, tables and stored procedures. The
default SQL*Plus logon value (username/password@connect_identifier) is
"system/oracle" but this can be overridden with the ORACLE_LOGON
environment variable. The implementation has been tested with Oracle
Express Edition 11g Release 2. Note that any SQL*Plus connection
warnings (user password expiration, etc) will interfere with the
ability of the wrapper script to communicate with the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The are almost 800 generic functional tests (for all implementations)
in the &lt;code&gt;tests/&lt;/code&gt; directory. Each step has a corresponding test file
containing tests specific to that step. The &lt;code&gt;runtest.py&lt;/code&gt; test harness
launches a Mal step implementation and then feeds the tests one at
a time to the implementation and compares the output/return value to
the expected output/return value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every implementation directory contains a Dockerfile to create
a docker image containing all the dependencies for that
implementation. In addition, the top-level Makefile contains support
for running the tests target (and perf, stats, repl, etc) within
a docker container for that implementation by passing &lt;em&gt;"DOCKERIZE=1"&lt;/em&gt;
on the make command line. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;make DOCKERIZE=1 "test^js^step3"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing implementations already have docker images built and pushed
to the docker registry. However, if
you wish to build or rebuild a docker image locally, the toplevel
Makefile provides a rule for building docker images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;make "docker-build^IMPL"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker images are named &lt;em&gt;"kanaka/mal-test-IMPL"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM-based language implementations (Groovy, Java, Clojure, Scala):
you will probably need to run this command once manually
first &lt;code&gt;make DOCKERIZE=1 "repl^IMPL"&lt;/code&gt; before you can run tests because
runtime dependencies need to be downloaded to avoid the tests timing
out. These dependencies are downloaded to dot-files in the /mal
directory so they will persist between runs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bootstrap post-collapse technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collapse OS is a z80 kernel and a collection of programs, tools and
documentation that allows you to assemble an OS that, when completed, will be
able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run on minimal and improvised machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit text files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replicate itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible.
With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to
manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e.
internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech
tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Schierl has put together &lt;a href="https://schierlm.github.io/CollapseOS-Web-Emulator/" rel="nofollow"&gt;a set of emulators running in the browser that
run Collapse OS in different contexts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using those while following along with the &lt;a href="doc/"&gt;User Guide&lt;/a&gt; is your quickest
path to giving Collapse OS a try.&lt;/p&gt;
